00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,450
This week's episode is brought to you by Harry's razors.

2
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:07,510
So you go to the drugstore to pick up some razors.

3
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:12,430
First, you have to find the guy who can open the case, then you have to wait around while he finds the

4
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:17,890
keys to the case. And then when the case finally gets open, your reward is paying 25 bucks for four

5
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:23,410
blades and some shaving cream. You leave muttering obscenities about the waste of time and money.

6
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:29,470
Such was the last straw for Andy, one of the co founders of Harry's razors, who was convinced that there

7
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:35,890
had to be a better way and there was focused on providing guys a great shaving experience where a fraction

8
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:41,170
of the price of the competition Harry's razors offers high quality blades engineered in their very own

9
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:44,770
German factory. Order online, it gets shipped to your home.

10
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:50,380
It's simple. I've got my own kit working for me as we speak, the blades are sharp, the razor design

11
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:57,190
is clean, which I like. And the cream is exactly what I need it to be no cuts, no irritation, it's great.

12
00:00:57,730 --> 00:01:02,230
And plus, I don't have to wait around for the guy with the keys just to pay way too much for it all.

15
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:41,560
The Rising Sun.Today marks the end of our run through the American Revolution, a revolution that wound

16
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:47,410
up taking more than 25 years to work through from the end of the French and Indian War in 1763.

17
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:51,370
To the sitting of the first Congress of the United States in 1789.

18
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:57,730
It started as a simple protest against an unpopular tax had somehow ballooned into a full scale war

19
00:01:57,730 --> 00:02:02,200
for independence, and then resulted in the founding of a new American Republic.

20
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:09,009.9
Today, that new American Republic will vote on whether to adopt a new constitution to replace the existing

21
00:02:09,039. --> 00:02:14,680
Articles of Confederation. It was a vote that would expose the deep divide within the revolutionary

22
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:17,920
generation about what the point of the revolution had even been.

23
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,560
We left off last time with the call for a convention to amend the Articles of Confederation.

24
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:30,800
This call was officially endorsed by the Congress of the Confederation on February the 21st 1787.

25
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:33,980
And so the convention was set to meet in Philadelphia in May.

26
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:39,020
In the intervening months, state legislatures began selecting delegates.

27
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:44,810
Not surprisingly, the men most willing to pack up and head to Philadelphia for the summer tended to

28
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:49,490
be men already predisposed to greatly enhancing the power of the national government.

29
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:53,960
Those who didn't care one way or the other obviously had no motivation to take part.

30
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:59,510
Well, those who actively oppose the project tended to boycott the convention as good for example, Patrick

31
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:05,180
Henry, who refused to serve as a member of Virginia's delegation because he smelt a rat in Philadelphia.

32
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:10,790
Unfortunately, for those opposed to amending the articles, their absence simply pack the convention

33
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:17,460
with men totally in favour of wholesale revisions.As the convention approach though, there was genuine

34
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:21,300
fear among the delegates that their recommendations would not be taken seriously.

35
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:27,390
So it was essential to secure the presence of the two men who would lend instant credibility and gravitas

36
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:33,420
to the proceedings. The first was Benjamin Franklin, recently returned from half a lifetime in Europe.

37
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:38,850
Franklin was breaking down physically, then had the convention been held anywhere in Philadelphia, he

38
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:42,690
could not have attended, but it was, and he believed in the cause.

39
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:49,140
So he lent his fame and prestige to the project. But the real key was, of course, George Washington,

40
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:54,060
it took a bit of products and Washington had just spent a whole war, dreaming of retirement.

41
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:59,880
But he did believe deeply in the goal of a strong national government, and was always susceptible to

42
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:03,840
the romance of setting aside personal interest in doing your public duty.

43
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:10,740
And so he agreed to leave Virginia's delegation, his presence guaranteed that the convention could not

44
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:19,950
just be dismissed.The Constitutional Convention as we now call it, was supposed to begin on May the

45
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:27,390
14th 1787. But 18th century travel being one it was almost no one was there on time.

46
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:33,990
But one guy who was there on time, who had gotten there early, in fact, was James Madison of Virginia,

47
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:39,600
who it has taken us the entire series to get to, but who is probably my favourite of the so called founding

48
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:45,300
fathers, probably because I studied political theory in school and political theory was the water within

49
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:51,760
which James Madison swam.James Madison was born in 1751.

50
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:56,950
So he was a little too young to be a major player in the run up to the War of Independence, and then

51
00:04:56,950 --> 00:05:02,520
standing at just five foot four inches and weighing noMore than 100 pounds, he was just too small to

52
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:06,090
be a soldier, which is why it has taken us the entire series to get to him.

53
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,200
Like the other leading Virginians, Madison inherited a lot of land and a lot of slaves.

54
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:16,270
But when it came time for the young man to pick a college, he did not follow his aristocratic brother

55
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:21,100
into the College of William and Mary, and instead headed up to the College of New Jersey, which is now

56
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:27,070
Princeton University. Now, I don't know how much of a role that kind of cross colonial experience played

57
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:32,230
in his eventual emergence as a strong proponent of national government, but it did certainly give him

58
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:38,660
a unique perspective.He spent the warrior serving in the Virginia House of Delegates where he came under

59
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:44,090
the sway of Thomas Jefferson, forging the political alliance that would define the first few decades

60
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:48,950
of American history. If I ever get around to writing that history of the political parties I'm always

61
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:54,200
talking about just know that Thomas Jefferson and James Madison will dominate the early episodes.

62
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,220
During his off hours, Madison read voraciously from the ancient Greeks to enlightenment philosophers

63
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:04,930
like Locke and Hobbes and of course, another favourite of mine Montesquieu, whose theories about separated

64
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:10,630
power struck a deep chord with Madison see develop a thoroughgoing critique of the Articles of Confederation.

65
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:14,050
He was a prime mover in the push to amend the articles.

66
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:19,900
So when it came time to finally get down to business in May 1787, he couldn't wait to get to Philadelphia

67
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:25,300
with his briefcase full of ideas. He's basically the kids so eager to take the task that he gets to

68
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:30,130
school like six hours early, and then drumming his fingers impatiently, waiting for the other knuckleheads

69
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:32,409
to show up so we can blow them all out of the water.

70
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,010
The rest of the knuckleheads started showing up by the end of May, and no, of course, they're not knuckleheads.

71
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:44,330
This is widely seen as one of the more impressive assemblies of leaders in American history.

72
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:49,670
Washington and Franklin were there of course, but also Alexander Hamilton of New York and a powerhouse

73
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:54,860
Pennsylvania delegation that included Robert Morris, the financer of the revolution, who deserves a

74
00:06:54,860 --> 00:07:00,530
supplemental, Governor Morris no relation, and then James Wilson, who along with Madison would come to

75
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:07,040
dominate the proceedings. Also present was john Dickinson, now representing Delaware and who, frankly,

76
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,170
I'd kind of like to write a book about at this point.

77
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:15,140
The Virginia delegation included Peyton Randolph and George Mason, who were both early radicals and

78
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:19,940
deeply committed patriots who will also wind up opposing the Finnish constitution.

79
00:07:20,659 --> 00:07:25,070
I could go on like this, but seriously, every state seem to be sending its best men.

80
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:30,860
Every state that is but Rhode Island, who refused to send any delegates to this ridiculous farce of

81
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:37,440
a convention.nodding approvingly from across the Atlantic, Thomas Jefferson called the delegates, nothing

82
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:42,780
less than an assembly of demigods. Or if you want to be less rapturous about it, you could call them

83
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:46,950
a bunch of rich white guys looking to make sure the little people didn't get ahold of the levers of

84
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:54,110
power.On May the 25th, there was finally a quorum of seven states, then business could begin.

85
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:59,390
Franklin nominated Washington to be president, and deliberations got underway.

86
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:05,270
Now unfortunately for historians, as the delegates started taking the floor, it was quickly agreed that

87
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:09,110
the only way this was going to work was if their debates were kept secret.

88
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:13,790
So detailed records of who said what, when just don't exist.

89
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,280
And we have to rely on informal vote counts and diary entries and a few scribbled summaries to get us

90
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:24,980
through it. This was probably not such a bad thing, especially since one of the other things they agreed

91
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:29,210
to right off the bat was that they were going to ignore whatever limited mandate they had to amend the

92
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:33,500
Articles of Confederation, and probably just rewrite the whole thing from scratch.

93
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:39,110
There was some brief protest to this, but as I said, the kind of guys who were willing to serve as delegates

94
00:08:39,409 --> 00:08:42,679
were also the kind of guys predisposed towards overhauling the articles.

95
00:08:43,039. --> 00:08:47,660
So the decision to press on with a whole new constitution met very little opposition.

96
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,220
And because Madison had gotten there first, and already had a pretty detailed outline for a new constitution

97
00:08:55,220 --> 00:09:01,490
in hand. The convention voted on May the 29th to take his work, dubbed the Virginia Plan as their starting

98
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:07,830
point.A few alternative plans popped up along the way, including a proposal by Charles pickney of South

99
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:13,080
Carolina and a proposal by Alexander Hamilton and then the New Jersey or small state plan that we'll

100
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:19,380
talk about in a minute. But through it all, the Virginia Plan was the plan that everyone agreed to work

101
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:24,630
with, and it contained most of the defining features of the Constitution final draft, the bicameral

102
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:30,390
legislature, the independent executive, the independent judiciary, all based on Montesquieu theories

103
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:36,330
of separated power, which Montesquieu had developed after reading our old old friend polybius, his analysis

104
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:43,530
of the Roman Republic.So the first major innovation contained in Madison's Virginia Plan was the separation

105
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:50,700
of the legislative branch into two houses. almost uniformly the delegates were small are Republicans,

106
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:57,180
not small d Democrats. So they agreed that some kind of Upper House would be needed to put the brakes

107
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:01,590
on the runaway anarchie shirt.billowing out of the lower house.

108
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:05,730
This is where, for example, Shays rebellion helps frame the debate.

109
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:09,180
No one thought it was a good idea to just let the people run amok.

110
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:12,780
I mean, they'll come in one day and just vote to abolish debt and contracts.

111
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:17,640
Plus they had the example of the Pennsylvania State Government meeting right down the street.

112
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:23,010
Pennsylvania had wound up drafting one of the most democratic constitutions in American history, with

113
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:27,900
an all powerful unicameral legislature. To men like Madison and Hamilton.

114
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:31,890
This was like completely crazy, and led to wild swings in policy.

115
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:36,690
Every time one of the bitter Pennsylvania political factions was able to outvote its rivals.

116
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:42,750
So yeah, some kind of Upper House was needed a more deliberative body made up of the better sorts.

117
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:51,100
Let's call it a Senate, like the old stoic Romans used to havethe next major overhaul was to the executive

118
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:56,620
branch. Now aside from talk, in some circles that George Washington ought to be crowned king was kind

119
00:10:56,620 --> 00:11:01,090
of taken for granted that the executive would be some kind of elected official serving some kind of

120
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:08,020
fixed term. But in Madison's plan, the executive would not be some your execute or have the legislature's

121
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:14,050
demand. The lack of a strong executive was seen as one of the great failings of the Articles of Confederation.

122
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:19,690
So the office would instead be independent, and invested with unique powers of its own, that would allow

123
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:25,780
it to check the scourge of a tyrannical legislature, just as the unique powers invested in the legislature

124
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:32,500
would allow it to check the scourge of a tyrannical executive, how the President, as the executive assumed

125
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:37,390
Doug would be elected and for how long he would serve, would all soon be points of contention.

126
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:43,390
But it was agreed in principle that an independent executive was essential for the stable and just operation

127
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:49,030
of government. And obviously, that everyone knew the first president would be George Washington helped

128
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:54,590
quell any fears of immediate tyranny.Finally, there was the matter of the courts.

129
00:11:54,860 --> 00:12:00,170
Now, the appointment of judges turned out to be an area Madison thought executives traditionally wielded

130
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:05,720
too much power. unchecked, the appointment power becomes a key instrument of tyranny.

131
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:09,800
So it's one of those things they had fought about during the English revolution, whether the king would

132
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:15,830
have the power to remove judges at his pleasure, or whether there had to be a legitimate case for dismissal.

133
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:21,920
If a king or governor or president has unlimited power of appointment, well, then the courts are just

134
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:26,060
going to do whatever the king or governor or president wants, and that's no good at all.

135
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:29,900
So the Virginia Plan placed judicial appointments in the hands of Congress.

136
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:35,360
But there's, of course wind up simply handing the tools of tyranny to the fickle mob, rather than some

137
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:41,000
power hungry tyrant, which was in many ways scarier to our small our republican delegates, which is

138
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,590
how we wound up with the compromised system whereby the President nominates judges and the senate confirms

139
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:52,920
them.As the delegates walked through the Virginia Plan, the first major point of contention was over

140
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:59,790
the issue of congressional representation. Being a good Virginian, Madison had devised a system of proportional

141
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:04,950
representation based on population size. This was of course a deal breaker for the smaller states like

142
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:10,020
Delaware, New Jersey and Connecticut, who could see their interest counting for very little in the United

143
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:16,080
States of Virginia. So, an alternate proposal was introduced by William Paterson of New Jersey, hence

144
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:23,510
it being dubbed the New Jersey plan.This plan was in its essence exactly what the convention was supposed

145
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:28,280
to have been about. It was drawn up as a list of amendments to the Articles of Confederation that would

146
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:34,670
maintain the supremely powerful single house of Congress and preserve the rule of one state, one vote,

147
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:39,950
while granting the national government more power to tax and regulate trade and enforce compliant with

148
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:45,260
a drops. In terms of overall form, the New Jersey plan went nowhere.

149
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:51,980
But that issue of is Congress and assembly of the state, or an assembly of the people was not going

150
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:58,170
to go away.After a few weeks of fruitless debates, the question was referred to a committee where the

151
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:03,480
famous Connecticut Compromise was hashed out. It was called the Connecticut Compromise because it was

152
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:09,300
hashed out by Roger Sherman of Connecticut, who gets a special shout out for being the only guy who

153
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:14,640
signed the Continental Association, the Declaration of Independence, the Articles of Confederation, and

154
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:17,490
in a couple months, the Constitution of the United States.

155
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:23,750
So good work, Roger Sherman,Sherman Steele was that the legislature would have the two houses prescribed

156
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:29,600
by Madison, lower house the House of Representatives would be based on population or the Upper House,

157
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:34,670
the Senate would be based on states, specifically two senators per state.

158
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,200
To help seal the deal with Madison, Hamilton and the other big state advocate.

159
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:45,960
It was stipulated that all revenue bills would originate in the population based Lower House, which

160
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:50,280
is how it still works today, in case you fell asleep during sophomore government class.

161
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:57,940
With these basic issues work through the convention created the Committee of Detail in late July to draw

162
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:03,660
up an official rough draftThis committee spent the next 10 days cobbling together sections of the Virginia

163
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:08,970
Plan approved language from the deliberations, various parts of state constitutions and whatever was

164
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:15,930
still viable from the Articles of Confederation. They reported out a preamble and 23 articles on August

165
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:22,110
the sixth, that mostly conformed to what had been agreed to, with a few rather glaring exceptions.

166
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:29,070
at the behest of Southern members, the committee had taken it upon itself to insert clauses that restricted

167
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:35,040
Congress's ability to interfere with slavery, and set the bar for approval of tariffs at two thirds

168
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:40,740
super majorities in both houses, both designed to protect the southern economy from Northern meddling.

169
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:47,370
It also tried to ignore the approved language, that Congress would have the power to legislate, quote,

170
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:54,480
over all cases of general interest. And instead, it drew up a list of 18 enumerated areas that Congress

171
00:15:54,480 --> 00:16:00,330
would be given jurisdiction over. But James Wilson of Pennsylvania killed this by tacking on at the

172
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:06,780
end, a 19th clause that said, Oh, and also Congress can pass any laws it deems necessary and proper for

173
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:11,730
the execution of government. In other words, go ahead and ignore that enumerated list.

174
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,860
When the Committee of Detail reported this draft, it was pretty well received, and most of it made its

175
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:24,490
way into the final draft. But the slavery and trade issues stuck out like sore thumbs and led to a whole

176
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:30,550
new round of wrangling. Luckily, the slavery issue also touched on one of the other big points yet to

177
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:35,590
be decided, because though it had been agreed that the House of Representatives would be rooted in proportional

178
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:42,370
representation, was not yet agreed how those proportions would be calculated to paint with a large brush.

179
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:46,900
The southern delegates wanted their slaves counted, the northern delegates did not.

180
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:52,600
This, of course, was the opposite of the positions taken during the debate over the Articles of Confederation,

181
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:58,330
when population size was about to become the basis of determining each state's financial obligation

182
00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:03,850
to the national government. In that case, the North wanted slaves counted, and the South did not.

183
00:17:04,329 --> 00:17:10,210
So clearly, everyone was working from a mentality of now make whatever argument gets you the most while

184
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:17,290
costing you the least.Finally, the two sides agreed to a set of compromises that settled everything

185
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:20,800
neatly. And without any troubling moral implications at all.

186
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:26,920
The South, gave up the two thirds majority requirement for tariffs, and agree that the final number

187
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:32,350
used to a lot seats in the House would also be used to determine financial obligations to the national

188
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:38,530
government. In exchange, the North agreed that that number would be calculated by adding up the free

189
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:46,510
population plus three fifths of all other persons, everyone knowing exactly what all other persons meant.

190
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:52,780
So right there in Article One, section two of the United States Constitution, it explicitly states that

191
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:59,620
an African American is three fifths of a person. Oh, by the way, it also says that Indians who do not

192
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:06,580
pay taxes are not even people at all. So yeah, like I say, no troubling moral implications at all.

193
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,800
With this compromise in place, the delegates decided that that was about all the heat they could stand

194
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:17,720
for the moment and they wrote in a clause for bidding Congress from taking any action on slavery for

195
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:23,480
25 years. Everyone agreed it would be much easier to just kick the can down the road on that one.

196
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,980
As the summer wound down, the SOTU did the convention, and on August the 31st, they created the committee

197
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:37,070
of postpone parts to take up the grab bag of leftover issues, a committee that was intentionally stacked

198
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:41,060
with delegates who have demonstrated a willingness to cut deals and make compromises.

199
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:47,060
Mostly, this was about crafting more precise language about how patents would be handled in the legal

200
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:52,460
process warmaking. But this last committee did lower the term of the president from seven to four years

201
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:57,290
and sanction the right to re election, which was actually a fairly big thing to just slip in at the

202
00:18:57,290 --> 00:19:03,560
last minute. It also drew up the final language for the electoral college system of presidential elections,

203
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:06,680
which don't even get me started about the Electoral College.

204
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,620
Everything was then handed to the committee for style on September the eighth for a final write up.

205
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:18,860
This committee was run by Madison Hamilton and Governor Morris, who actually gets most of the credit

206
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:21,980
for writing the final draft, including the famous preamble.

207
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,180
The committee for style produced its final draft on September the 12th.

208
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:32,990
rearranging the previous 23 articles into seven Main articles, each divided into subsections, which

209
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:38,330
is why lawyers quote the constitution article two section three, the way a preacher quotes the Bible,

210
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:45,140
chapter and verse.Article One dealt with the legislative branch, since everyone assumed that that would

211
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:50,540
be the most important branch. They would come as quite a shock to the framers to see just how presidential

212
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:56,310
the government of the United States has become.Article two dealt with the executive branch run by a

213
00:19:56,310 --> 00:20:02,250
president elected every four years with the power to appoint judgesveto laws and act as commander in

214
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:07,630
chief of the armed forces.article three covered the judicial branch, which is actually pretty hilariously

215
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:13,990
underdeveloped in the actual text of the Constitution, with no mention whatsoever of the power of judicial

216
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:20,140
review. That is the ability to declare laws unconstitutional, which is obviously like what the Supreme

217
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:26,110
Court actually does these days. If you stayed awake in sophomore government, you know that that power

218
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:31,270
was simply asserted by Chief Justice john Marshall in the 1803 case, Marbury vs.

219
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:34,360
Madison, which is something you can needle your friends about.

220
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:39,490
They ever start going on about how they want strict construction as judges because a strict constructionist

221
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:44,710
judge would have to admit that the supreme court does not have the power to declare laws unconstitutional.

222
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,800
Article four covered relations between the federal government and the states and then between the states

223
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:54,010
themselves. Article five covered the amendment process.

224
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:58,120
Article six establishes the constitution as the supreme law of the land.

225
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:03,190
And article seven lays out the ratification process, which we'll get to in a minute.

226
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:12,420
On September 15, these seven articles were unanimously approved by the 11 states able to vote, Rhode

227
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:19,020
Island never did send anyone and Alexander Hamilton to New York colleagues had been among the 13 delegates

228
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:25,380
who quit the convention early. So New York didn't have a vote led to the nice line in Washington's diary

229
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:29,160
that the constitution was approved by 11 states and Colonel Hamilton.

230
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,340
39 men wound up signing the Constitution, with only three of the remaining delegates refusing to sign

231
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:40,860
Peyton Randolph and George Mason of Virginia, and elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts.

232
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,520
All three of them have their reasons for opposing the draft.

233
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:49,740
But the most important for our purposes was it they did not contain some kind of enumerated Bill of

234
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:55,620
Rights, explicitly drawing the lines that no matter what the government would not be able to cross.

235
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:02,370
In hindsight, the omission of the Bill of Rights turned out to be a major unforced error for proponents

236
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:07,080
of ratification. But for whatever reason, they had never drawn one up and weren't about to do it.

237
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:12,180
Now at the last minute. A few delegates thought for example, the George Mason's push to tack one on

238
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:14,970
was just a stall tactic to torpedo the whole project.

239
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:19,980
So they ignored the issue and sign the damn thing on September the 17th 1787.

240
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:27,890
They could all go home.As the convention ended, Benjamin Franklin offered a final few memorable quotes

241
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:33,740
about what had been achieved. After remarking that the constitution was not perfect, and that every

242
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:36,800
one of them could point to something in particular they didn't like about it.

243
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:41,390
He told his fellow delegates that during their deliberations, he'd often considered the painting on

244
00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:47,360
the back of the President's chair, depicting a sun on the horizon, without being able to tell whether

245
00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:53,360
it was rising or sitting. But now at length, I have the happiness to know that it is a rising and not

246
00:22:53,390 --> 00:23:00,020
a setting sun.Then, of course, there was the likely apocryphal line uttered as the delegates dispersed,

247
00:23:00,530 --> 00:23:06,050
asked by Elizabeth Powell, who is by the by an utterly fascinating woman, what form of government the

248
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:10,550
convention had created, he said, a republic mme, if you can keep it.

249
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,920
But for the moment, the question was not whether this new model for national Republic would be kept.

250
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:19,830
But whether or not it would be launched in the first place.

251
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:25,620
As I mentioned, the deliberations of the convention had been secret, and no rumours swirled, it was

252
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:30,450
still something of a shock to discover that the states were about to be asked to vote not on a few amendments,

253
00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:36,090
but on a whole new system of government. And not only that, the vote would take place according to rules

254
00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:40,110
completely outside the system set up by the articles for ratifying amendments.

255
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:47,280
As I hinted last time, the requirement of unanimous consent was regarded as unworkable, giving everyone

256
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:50,580
a veto over everyone else, so that nothing would ever get done.

257
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:57,240
So the framers wrote into article seven that only nine of 13 states needed to ratify for the constitution

258
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:03,270
to take effect. Then, in another calculated bit of stacking the deck in their favour, they prescribed

259
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:08,430
that the process of ratification would run through state conventions specifically called to decide the

260
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:12,360
issue not I repeat, not through state legislatures.

261
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:18,330
This was critical, because no one would lose more power if the Constitution was ratified than the state

262
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:26,140
legislatures.The Congress of the Confederation received the signed constitution on September the 20th,

263
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:29,530
and voted A week later to send it to the states for ratification.

264
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,860
But even before this vote was taken, the war over ratification was underway.

265
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:39,780
Because though we've mostly been talking about the guys who favoured a stronger national government,

266
00:24:40,170 --> 00:24:45,480
there was strong opposition in almost every state to the very idea of a stronger national government.

267
00:24:45,810 --> 00:24:49,530
Seeing is how defeating centralised tyranny had been the whole point of the revolution.

268
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:54,420
And here we are not five years removed from the Treaty of Paris, and you want to hand the keys over

269
00:24:54,420 --> 00:25:00,180
to some corrupt despot. And yes, we know Washington will be the first president but for God's sakesWhat

270
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:05,400
about the next president? And look, you've got standing armies in here and what is necessary and proper

271
00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:10,080
even mean? And sounds like Congress is just going to be able to get their hands into everything.

272
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:17,820
Opponents of ratification were a diverse long and not at all unified, and they quickly fell prey to a

273
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:24,480
clever bit of political labelling. Proponents of ratification were calling themselves Federalists, and

274
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:30,090
they managed to dub their opponent anti Federalists, as if they were simply on renewal standing in the

275
00:25:30,090 --> 00:25:35,550
way of America's rise to power, rather than what it's fair to actually call them the keepers of the

276
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:41,760
original revolutionary flame. In terms of ideological rhetoric, the anti Federalists can draw a straight

277
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:48,630
line all the way back to 1763. The Federalists on the other hand, had to somehow prove that that rhetoric

278
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:54,210
had been fine in its time, but we need to survive as an independent nation now, and it's time to get

279
00:25:54,210 --> 00:26:00,560
real.Now one of the things I love about the Federalist anti federalist campaigns is that everyone's

280
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:03,470
revolutionary credentials were positively sparkling.

281
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:09,680
Anti Federalists like Patrick Henry and George Mason and George Clinton had given everything they had

282
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:15,320
to the Patriot cause and believe deeply, that the constitution was a betrayal of the revolution.

283
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:21,800
Just as Hamilton and Madison, Washington and Franklin had given everything they had to the Patriot cost,

284
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:28,220
and believe deeply that the constitution was the fulfilment of the revolution, thing that would guarantee

285
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:35,240
the survival of an American Republic.As the battle lines were being drawn, both sides picked up pins

286
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:39,560
and started railing against each other, often using well known Roman pseudonyms.

287
00:26:39,770 --> 00:26:45,380
So the anti Federalists were Brutus, and Cato, and they argued that the constitution invested too much

288
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:50,330
power in the central government, that the President would soon enough be a king, that the long thought

289
00:26:50,330 --> 00:26:55,940
for sovereignty of the state was being destroyed, that no Republic could survive if it tried to encompass

290
00:26:55,940 --> 00:27:01,580
so vast an area and so many different people. And above all, they agree that the failure to include

291
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:09,460
a Bill of Rights was an unconscionable omission.On the other side, the Federalist ran with a campaign

292
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:14,980
that played up the support of Washington and Franklin, the existential threat posed by the current disunity

293
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:20,230
of the state. And the fact that the states themselves were not doing a very good job of running things.

294
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:25,960
But of course, the most famous batch of polemics that came out of the ratification campaigns, where

295
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:32,950
the Federalist set of 85 essays published in New York under the pseudonym Publius, after our old old

296
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:39,100
old friend Kubilius hilarious, and written by Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and john J.

297
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:45,980
The most famous of these is probably federalist number 10, which argue that the National Union was a

298
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:51,320
necessary safeguard against internal factionalism and interaction, and pretty much demolished the argument

299
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:54,230
that a republic could only survive if it was small in size.

300
00:27:54,920 --> 00:28:00,740
Number 10, written by Madison argued that in fact, the opposite was true that the larger the Republic,

301
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:04,160
the less likely it was to be hijacked by narrow interest groups.

302
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:10,250
Other Greatest Hits include number 51, which is the definitive statement on how the system of checks

303
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:16,100
and balances works. And number 78, written by Hamilton, which is the one that says that judicial review

304
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:19,280
is actually a thing, even if it's not there in the actual text.

305
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:26,030
Now, something I didn't know going into this was the anthem time the Federalist essays were not influential

306
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:30,770
at all. They were neither widely read, nor timely enough to sway opinion.

307
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:36,110
Today, of course, they are fundamental to understanding how the federal government is supposed to work

308
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:42,290
and are cited regularly in judicial opinions and act as basically an annotated reference manual to the

309
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:51,040
Constitution.The first state to ratify was Delaware, on December the seventh 1787.

310
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:57,610
The lower counties had suffered mightily under the Articles of Confederation, and without a strong port

311
00:28:57,610 --> 00:29:01,810
of their own had to rely on the whims of New York and Pennsylvania for all trade.

312
00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:11,800
ratification was swift and unanimous.Surprisingly, Pennsylvania became the second state to ratify surprising

313
00:29:12,010 --> 00:29:14,950
because there were strong anti federalist feeling across the state.

314
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:19,900
Remember, these are the same guys who came up with the radically democratic unicameral legislature.

315
00:29:20,650 --> 00:29:26,260
So the Federalists acted quickly and ruthlessly, to ratify the Constitution before opposition forces

316
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:31,300
could really organise themselves. The state ratifying convention was assembled on November the 20th.

317
00:29:31,690 --> 00:29:37,630
And after furious debate seem to be headed for ratification, when opposition anti Federalists deserted

318
00:29:37,630 --> 00:29:41,350
the hall to deny their opponents the necessary quorum to take the vote.

319
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:47,710
federalist delegates literally hunted down and dragged a few hiding anti Federalists back into the State

320
00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:51,820
House, declared a quorum and voted for ratification on December the 12th.

321
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:57,790
New Jersey followed a few days later and ratified unanimously they being in the same basic situation

322
00:29:57,790 --> 00:30:03,840
as Delaware than Georgia.followed with a unanimous vote of its own on January the second, because now

323
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:07,950
that they didn't have the British to protect them from Indian attacks, they needed the federal government,

324
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:11,160
Connecticut and join them all on January the ninth.

325
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,600
So this brought the movement to its first great test, Massachusetts.

326
00:30:16,470 --> 00:30:19,110
still reeling from the anarchy of Shay's rebellion.

327
00:30:19,410 --> 00:30:24,600
The leaders of Massachusetts who might have been inclined to try to go it alone, wound up fairly evenly

328
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:27,720
divided on the matter. When the state convention met on January the ninth.

329
00:30:28,530 --> 00:30:30,960
They spent nearly a month at each other's throats.

330
00:30:31,170 --> 00:30:36,330
But it would appear that the decisive break came when Sam Adams and john Hancock were persuaded to vote

331
00:30:36,330 --> 00:30:39,480
yes, and bring along the bloc of voters they control.

332
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:46,560
Massachusetts ratified the constitution on February the sixth by a vote of 187 to 168.

333
00:30:47,370 --> 00:30:52,080
It was a close thing, but it lent the ratification movement a huge dose of momentum.

334
00:30:52,530 --> 00:30:55,920
I mean, if the boys in Boston or Ford, it can't be all bad.

335
00:30:56,790 --> 00:31:03,660
But critically, the Massachusetts convention requested 19 alterations be made alterations that amounted

336
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:08,580
to a warning that unless some kind of Bill of Rights was attached to this thing, the new federal government

337
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:17,810
was going to be in deep trouble.The first state to say no, was naturally Rhode Island.

338
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:23,390
Having never sent delegates to the convention, the leaders of Rhode Island left it to a public referendum

339
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:27,350
that saw the odious national power grab shot down in a landslide.

340
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:34,000
This blip aside, though, Maryland voted to ratify in April, and then South Carolina in May, South Carolina,

341
00:31:34,090 --> 00:31:36,820
also strongly urging the adoption of a bill of rights.

342
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:42,040
Something all federalist now took for granted would be one of the first things they took care of when

343
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:51,410
hopefully, the first Congress took its seat.So that meant that by June 17, at eight of the 13 states

344
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:59,110
had ratified, one short of the required nine.in that month, three states began to Liberation's Virginia,

345
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:05,320
New York and New Hampshire. If just one of them ratified the constitution would take effect.

346
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:11,350
But it was not lost on anyone that if something along the lines of say New Hampshire saying yes, but

347
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:16,000
Virginia and New York saying no, then it would be really difficult to proceed.

348
00:32:16,450 --> 00:32:25,440
Nine of 13 states are not.In Virginia, the anti Federalists were led by the enormously influential Patrick

349
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:30,720
Henry, and lent considerable weight by George Mason and Peyton Randolph, who could say that they'd been

350
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,510
there when the thing was written, and they did not like what it said.

351
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:39,740
Virginia had every means at its disposal to proceed outside of a National Union.

352
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:45,770
And the most of fear from a bunch of small states banding together to dictate terms mighty Virginia.

353
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:52,730
it wound up being an incredibly close race. And until the vote was actually taken, no one knew which

354
00:32:52,730 --> 00:32:58,460
way it would go, especially since everyone realised that Virginia's vote would be the vote to establish

355
00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:03,380
the union. Except it turns out it really wasn't because New Hampshire ratified four days before the

356
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:08,480
Virginia vote, earning New Hampshire the title, the state that ratified the Constitution.

357
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:15,610
But the Virginians didn't know that yet. And so their vote maintain the solemn gravi toss that Virginians

358
00:33:15,610 --> 00:33:20,200
like to attach to things they voted in favour 89 to 79.

359
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:27,040
But like Massachusetts, in South Carolina, they also demanded amendments, the Bill of Rights was now

360
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:32,220
a foregone conclusion.This put New York in a bind.

361
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:38,910
The state was pretty wildly anti federalist, and its dominant political leader George Clinton was prepared

362
00:33:38,910 --> 00:33:43,620
to go it alone and had Virginia not ratified. I'm sure that's exactly what he would have done.

363
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:50,310
But Virginia did ratify. And so staying out of the Union was now a far trickier proposition.

364
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:55,410
The Alexander Hamilton led federalist did not have the votes to compel ratification.

365
00:33:55,770 --> 00:34:00,660
But they did manage to produce one little trump card that did help convince Clinton to lay down his

366
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:07,560
guns. New York City itself was dominated by Federalists and they threatened to secede from the state

367
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:11,219
and join the union themselves if the rest of the state didn't get on board.

368
00:34:12,179 --> 00:34:16,170
Clinton freed up just enough voters to let New York ratify 30 to 27.

369
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:21,690
On July the 26th. This left only North Carolina and Rhode Island out of the Union.

370
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:28,889
North Carolina wouldn't join until November 1789. Rhode Island would hold out until May 1790.

371
00:34:29,370 --> 00:34:33,780
So first to declare independence. Last to ratify the Constitution.

372
00:34:34,350 --> 00:34:43,270
God bless you, Rhode Island. I love you.With the Constitution in effect, elections for the inaugural

373
00:34:43,270 --> 00:34:46,989
government were held over the winter of 1788 1789.

374
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:50,710
with George Washington, of course, elected president unanimously.

375
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:56,110
As I mentioned, one of the first orders of business for the new government would be to drop a list of

376
00:34:56,110 --> 00:34:59,410
amendment that would satisfy all those calls for a bill of rights.

377
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:07,290
James Madison himself introduced a list of 12 in August 1789 10 of which would eventually be adopted.

378
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:14,820
These amendments are focused not on structural changes to the government, but rather on protecting individual

379
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:21,030
rights from state abuse. And they included all the Greatest Hits freedom of speech, freedom of the press,

380
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:27,750
freedom of religion, freedom from unreasonable search and seizure, guarantees of habeas corpus and trial

381
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:34,380
by jury and access to legal counsel. Accompanying This episode is a supplemental where I read the bill

382
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:40,560
of rights in full, please go listen to it. It encompasses just about everything I love about America.

383
00:35:40,890 --> 00:35:46,140
And for all our faults and all of our mistakes. I believe the Bill of Rights will stand today and tomorrow

384
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:52,230
and forever as objectively worthy of universal admiration, and they should hang on the wall of every

385
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:59,460
classroom. Now that they have been adopted, we can close this chapter of the revolutions podcast.

386
00:36:00,330 --> 00:36:05,340
And just in time to because in a few days, I will be flying to London for the first revolutions podcast

387
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:11,310
tour, where we will get to relive the glory of the English revolution and get fired up for the coming

388
00:36:11,310 --> 00:36:17,340
French Revolution. Since I obviously can't do any real work during those 11 days, I'm going to have

389
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:23,880
to be gone for longer than the four weeks. So I am officially setting the break to end on oh look at

390
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,470
that Bastille Day.
