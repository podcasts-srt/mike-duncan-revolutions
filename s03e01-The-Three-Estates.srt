14
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:34,590
know who sent you.Hello, and welcome to revolutions Episode 3.1, the three estates we come now to the

15
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:40,320
greatest revolution of them all, the French Revolution, the standard by which all other revolutions

16
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:45,539
are measured. It was one of the most important events in the history of the world, and is widely pointed

17
00:01:45,539 --> 00:01:51,450
to as marking the beginning of the modern era. Since its passing, it has also become one of the most

18
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:55,830
bought over pieces of intellectual real estate among scholars of all disciplines.

19
00:01:56,130 --> 00:02:02,130
History, obviously, but also economics and sociology and philosophy and political science.

20
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:05,580
Everyone has something to say about the French Revolution.

21
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,740
And just to keep things interesting, there is almost no agreement about what its causes were, what its

22
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:13,770
consequences were nor even what actually happened.

23
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:21,600
Probably the most influential grand theory of the French Revolution came from the Marxists, who painted

24
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:28,200
a deliciously plausible theory that during the 1700s, the pro capitalist French bourgeoisie acquired

25
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:33,630
a majority share of the nation's wealth, while simultaneously being denied access to political power

26
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,530
within an archaic feudal system later dubbed the Austrian regime.

27
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:45,030
So the turbulence of the revolution was simply the obsolete political structure being forced into alignment

28
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:51,780
with the modern economic structure in Marxist history, the French Revolution is the great bourgeois

29
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:57,990
revolution that both destroyed the feudalism of the past and set the stage for the socialism of the future.

30
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:03,750
Like I say, this is a deliciously plausible theory, easy to hold in your head.

31
00:03:04,079. --> 00:03:06,959
And in broad terms, it looks an awful lot like what happened.

32
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:14,400
But while Marxist theory thrives in the big picture, it usually gets beaten up pretty bad when the details

33
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:20,370
are scrutinised. That's when we find out that big chunks of the nobility were involved in various modernising

34
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:25,530
and capitalist enterprises. And far from wanting to tear down the feudal apparatus members of the bourgeoisie

35
00:03:25,829 --> 00:03:30,900
turned out to be some of the fiercest defenders of seigneury, all dues and noble privileges, because

36
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:35,970
they had just purchased access to those senatorial dues and noble privileges, and wanted to protect

37
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:40,620
their investments. Not all of them did this mind you, but some of them did.

38
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:46,230
Certainly enough to make the story of a battle between one class representing the old ways, and another

39
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:52,080
class representing the new ways fall apart, which is kind of a pity because it's a great theory.

40
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:58,560
But after all, the revisionism and post revisionism and repost revisionism revolution has been stripped

41
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,880
of all order, and frankly returned to its native state of pure chaos.

42
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:09,930
But before we can get into the endlessly fascinating and occasionally terrifying march of the French

43
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:16,230
Revolution, we must as usual lay our groundwork. So the rest of this week's episode will be taken up

44
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:21,930
with a rundown of the people who made up pre revolutionary France, taking as our framework the famous

45
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:28,770
three estates. We'll start with the lowly peasant, and wind up with the allegedly absolute monarch of

46
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:32,460
this allegedly absolute monarchy, King Louie the 16th.

47
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:39,539
The next week, we will walk through the mess of political, economic, cultural and religious problems

48
00:04:39,539 --> 00:04:46,260
that the Austrian regime was facing. When Comptroller General cologne told the king in August 1786,

49
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:51,750
that unless drastic financial reforms were initiated, a monarchy was going to go broke.

50
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,010
On the eve of the Revolution, the population of France was somewhere around 27 million.

51
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:03,980
So right away, it's worth noting just in terms of scale, we are an order of magnitude beyond the English

52
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:09,710
and American Revolutions, both of which involve millions of people, rather than 10s of millions of people.

53
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,080
These 10s of millions mostly lived in rural areas and were tied to the land.

54
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:19,310
The rest lived in small towns, a few larger provincial cities.

55
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:24,200
And then of course, Paris, which was not just the preeminent city in France, but was in many ways the

56
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:30,050
preeminent city in Europe. Regardless of where they live, though, the French people were divided up

57
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:35,420
into the famous three estates, the division still lingering from the old mediaeval days when society

58
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:39,770
could be separated into those who prayed, those who fought and those who worked.

59
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:44,150
The first estate, those who prayed was the clergy.

60
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:51,200
Second estate, those who fought was the nobility. And the third estate, those who worked was everyone

61
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:55,280
else. That is to say something like 95% of the population.

62
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:03,110
The vast majority of the third estate, and about four fifths of the total population of France were

63
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:09,440
peasants. These peasants can be divided up into three basic subgroups at the bottom where your landless

64
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:13,460
peasants are forced to become migrant workers or day labourers to stay alive.

65
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:19,400
In many areas, these landless peasants could pick up work and say textile manufacturing, as pre industrial

66
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:24,860
France relied on accumulating the products of 1000s of individual homes rather than consolidating workers

67
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:31,070
in a single factory. But as we'll discuss a bit next week, on the eve of the revolution, these pitiful

68
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:36,470
folks were dealing with the terrible conundrum of price inflation that was not being matched by wage

69
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:42,380
increases, so even those who found work can often not afford the most basic necessities of life.

70
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:49,610
They might then turn to professional begging, petty theft, and outright banditry as circumstances dictated.

71
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:57,170
Above the landless peasants, you had peasants who owned or leased a little land of their own.

72
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:03,140
But one of the problems of French agriculture was that the land was divided up into these little tiny

73
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:07,669
plots that could barely sustain a family, let alone produce a surplus for market.

74
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:14,210
Numerous foreign observers passing through 18th century France commented on just how backward and inefficient

75
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:18,950
French agriculture was, but the North was starting to get into larger scale production.

76
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:24,680
The dream of the small holding peasants was to rise up into the ranks of the third and smallest of the

77
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:30,980
peasant subgroups. Independent farmers, who own not only enough land to sustain themselves, but also

78
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:35,180
provide jobs for the rural workers and loan out equipment to their poor neighbours.

79
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:41,090.
These operators were generally loathed and envied by the lower order peasants, who lived in fear of

80
00:07:41,090. --> 00:07:44,870
seeing their own precious holdings gobbled up if they ever fell behind on alone.

81
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:49,610
while simultaneously aspiring to join the ranks of the independent farmers they feared.

82
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:57,470
Leaving behind the peasants in the countryside, the remainder of the three estates lived in urban areas,

83
00:07:57,830 --> 00:08:03,950
though calling them urban is not quite right, as most held less than 2000 people, and only a few cities

84
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:10,700
exceeded 50,000, like Leone in the east, or say down along the Mediterranean, or Bordeaux on the Atlantic

85
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:20,240
coast, another 650,000 jam themselves into Paris. Inside the towns and cities, we first find the corollary

86
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:23,480
of the poor peasant in the poor, unskilled labour.

87
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:29,210
These folks are the ones who make getting an accurate gauge on just how many peasants there were difficult,

88
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:34,640
as they were often seasonal migrants from the countryside or relatives of poor agricultural workers

89
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,480
looking for a better or at least a different opportunity in the towns.

90
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:44,000
The best job these poor unskilled workers could hope for would be as a servant in the homes of the better

91
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,670
off families. But barring that, they were forced to rely on the uncertainties of day labour and temporary

92
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:55,460
work projects. They crammed into terrible housing, and often wound up in line for charity from local

93
00:08:55,460 --> 00:09:02,870
religious orders. Above the unskilled workers, we find not surprisingly the skilled workers.

94
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:09,050
The organisation of the skilled workers was itself one of the little tributaries feeding into the great

95
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:11,810
river that is the causes of the French Revolution.

96
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:17,030
Because the guild system in all of its restrictive glory, was still in full effect.

97
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:23,120
apprentices were a little more than indentured servants forced to serve some specified time say seven

98
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,640
years before they were allowed to become journeyman.

99
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:31,190
At which point they often took to the road to ply their trade and get into nasty fights with local competitors

100
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:36,860
or other journeymen they happen to run across. After whatever arbitrary time was up, they were allowed

101
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:42,260
to become masters buying their way into the club and settling down to set up a permanent shop, taking

102
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:45,230
on apprentices and starting the whole cycle over again.

103
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:51,800
The Guild system was a source of constant frustration for those not directly profiting from it.

104
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,290
And as the 1700s progressed, an economic theory turned to free trade.

105
00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:01,420
The continued existence of the mediaeval guild system was an affront to thinking men everywhere.

106
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:07,930
It is also worth mentioning that it will be from the ranks of these urban workers both skilled and unskilled

107
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:15,160
that the famous son que la will come storming out of as the revolution picks up steam on cue lot, meaning

108
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:19,180
those who did not wear the silk knee breeches favoured by the upper classes.

109
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:27,610
Above the skilled workers, we move into the ranks of the secure urban elite, the guys who did favour

110
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:30,910
silk knee breeches, known to us as the bourgeoisie.

111
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:38,710
Now, bourgeoisie is a pretty nebulous concept. And in strict Marxist terminology, they are simply the

112
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:43,210
owners of the means of production, that is the merchants and industrialists and bankers.

113
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:49,660
But in a broader sense, the bourgeoisie also included the middle class professionals, lawyers and doctors

114
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:55,360
and men of letters. Collectively, they were one of the fastest growing demographic groups in 18th century

115
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,660
France, and now held a large portion of the nation's wealth.

116
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:06,040
But critically, since we are still living in the Austrian regime, if you were ambitious, you generally

117
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:09,370
did not funnel your money back into the trades that had enriched you.

118
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:12,970
Instead, you aimed at buying your way into the nobility.

119
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:19,330
So you transfer the money you made in the grubby business of trade into land on the one hand, or venal

120
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:26,020
office on the other. land has, of course been the great marker of wealth and status for, let's say,

121
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:31,720
the entire history of civilization. So I don't think that needs much explanation side for mentioning

122
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:36,910
that when the up and coming bourgeoisie bought the land, they were quite a bit more diligent about enforcing

123
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:42,550
whatever feudal claims could be made on the tenants claims that the former noble owners had often long

124
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:48,819
since forgotten about. And in many provinces, complaints about the new bourgeois landlords far outnumbered

125
00:11:48,819 --> 00:11:56,200
complaints about the old aristocratic landlords. The other great investment opportunity was venal office,

126
00:11:56,650 --> 00:12:01,300
and venal office is simply a government office that is purchased rather than appointed.

127
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:07,360
They were dreamed up first by Louis the 14th, but then massively expanded by his successor, Louie the

128
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:13,510
15th. As an easy way to generate revenue for the state without forcing the Royal ministry to levy new

129
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:21,400
taxes which the nobility would no doubt resist. the eve of the revolution nearly every one of the 70,000

130
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:27,580
offices of government was a venal office, most of them actually did tie into a real job.

131
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:33,250
But some of the most coveted like that of King secretary was simply an empty title that carried with

132
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:39,819
it certain privileges, all kinds of privileges. Well, many of them came with a promise of ennoblement.

133
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:46,180
Most had to be held for a few successive generations for the nobleman to kick in, but some including

134
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:50,590
the aforementioned Office of King secretary, brought in nobleman immediately.

135
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:56,890
These offices also usually carried packs exemptions of various shapes and sizes, because as we'll discuss

136
00:12:56,890 --> 00:13:02,410
a bit more next week, pre revolutionary France operated on the rather upside down principle that the

137
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:08,710
better off you were, the less you paid in taxes. Over the years, these offices became a form of property

138
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:14,470
in themselves. And as the ranks of the bourgeoisie expanded, the prices of the vino offices Rose with

139
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:20,560
demand. By the late 1780, something close to a billion lever was tied up in venal office.

140
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:29,319
And yes, that is an insane amount of money. At the very tippy top of the third estate was a little group

141
00:13:29,319 --> 00:13:35,860
who quote, lived nobley that is they no longer even worked at a profession, but instead lived off land

142
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:41,500
rents or other investments. The reason this group was so small, was because if you had acquired the

143
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:47,890
means to live nobley, you were probably in the process of buying your way into the nobility, that is

144
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:52,030
the second estate and leaving the ranks of the third estate behind for good.

145
00:13:54,910 --> 00:14:00,460
So with the help of some venal office, it's time to move up into the second estate, the nobility.

146
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:08,890
By this point, the population of the nobility was somewhere between 120,400 1000 Records being patchy

147
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:12,790
and often unreliable, since there were more than a few forge claims out there.

148
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:19,750
This little click and we're talking no more than one to 2% of the population owned outright a quarter

149
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:25,300
to a third of all the land in France, and held feudal rights over the rest that is the right to collect

150
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:30,760
certain taxes the right to force tenants to use your mills and wine presses at whatever arbitrary price

151
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:36,880
you've set. They also openly owned a controlling interest in almost all the non trading commercial pursuits

152
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:42,370
like mining and metallurgy and less openly owned a controlling interest in most of the trading industry.

153
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:47,410
Using surrogates in the third estate to skirt prohibitions on the nobles engaging in trade.

154
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:52,650
So far from resisting the evolution from feudalism to capitalism.

155
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:58,110
The nobility was right in the middle of it, at least some of them were because the nobility was not

156
00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:05,580
at all one unified. Call. Last. For starters, as you can imagine the old nobility, the ones who could

157
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:12,000
trace their lineage back 700 years did not think much of the new nobility, you know the textile merchants

158
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:18,180
who just bought his title last Thursday. These two types were described as the sword nobility and the

159
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:23,910
road nobility. The former owe their status to their mediaeval ancestors having fought alongside the

160
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:30,690
king, the ladder to some recently acquired venal office, and by recent, the old nobility meant anything

161
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:36,810
less than about four generations. So the sword nobility generally turned up their noses at the robe,

162
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:41,880
nobility, or the robe, nobility were ticked off that having climbed into the ranks of the second estate,

163
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:47,670
they were still being treated as commoners. It also did not help that because of the way French inheritance

164
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:52,260
laws worked the fortunes of the old nobility and generally eroded to almost nothing.

165
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:57,990
So most of the wealth of the second estate was held by these former shopkeepers who didn't even know

166
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:04,110
what fork to use at dinner. Not that the cultivated old nobles were at all opposed to marrying their

167
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:07,260
sons to the daughters of these barbaric new nobles.

168
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:14,010
At the very top rung of the nobility, though, were those who both held ancient lineages, and had managed

169
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:20,430
to keep their fortunes intact, or had successfully gilded their arms as the same went by a fortuitous

170
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:26,040
marriage or two along the way. These guys were the ones who were still able to afford to live with the

171
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:31,530
king at Versailles. And they dominated all the major positions in the Royal ministry, the military,

172
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:38,069.
the judiciary in the church. This group, as you can imagine, tended to be rather conservative, but it

173
00:16:38,069. --> 00:16:43,500
is also from these ranks that we find some of the key members of the liberal nobility who will be so

174
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:48,870
essential to the first stage of the revolution. For example, our old friend, the Marquis de Lafayette.

175
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:58,260
So that brings us to the first estate, the church, there were about 130,000 members of the French clergy,

176
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:02,280
and collectively, the church owned about 10% of all the land in France.

177
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:08,280
But as the great historian George Lefevre noted in his compact but highly influential coming of the

178
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:14,339
French Revolution, when you talk about the three states of the osteon regime, you're really only talking

179
00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:20,940
about two estates, the nobility and the comments, because the church was really just a microcosm of

180
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:28,560
the kingdom at large. Way back in 1516, the pope had conceded to the King of France The right to appoint

181
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:34,500
all the bishops and abbots of the French church. Not surprisingly, these top level jobs which carried

182
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:40,560
with them massive salaries, but right to collect tithes and control of all those church held lands,

183
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,530
became dominated by the younger sons of the French nobility.

184
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:50,940
Meanwhile, the vast majority of the 130,000 clergy were parish priests, recruited from the ranks of

185
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:57,240
the third estate. And usually the lower rungs of the third estate at that not the lowest lowest rungs

186
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:00,510
into your family still had to buy you some kind of rudimentary education.

187
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:06,180
But there was still a massive gulf between the noble ecclesiastical authorities on the one hand, and

188
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:11,790
the common rank and file priesthood on the other. This will become a point of major importance with

189
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:17,070
new states general get called because the parish priests who had thus far no say in how church wealth

190
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:21,510
was distributed, and who always seem to see none of the type of money that is supposed to be you know,

191
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:28,260
maintaining our parishes, will finally get to voice their displeasure of the fat cat Archbishop's and

192
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:31,920
parasitic monastic orders, who were giving the church a bad name.

193
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:40,860
So finally, we come to the top of every pyramid, the centre of every circle, the King of France.

194
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:46,080
And we'll end today with a brief history of the bourbon dynasty, down to the man who finally landed

195
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:55,260
on the whammy. King Louie the 16th. So in 1268, a daughter and heir to the state of bourbon, married

196
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:58,889
a younger son of King Louie the ninth St. Louis to his friends.

197
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:05,010
This Borbon branch of the royal family plugged along for nine generations, becoming the kings of tiny

198
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:10,860
Navarre in the Pyrenees along the way until some nasty business in the 1580s known as the War of the

199
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:16,710
three Henry's broke out, during which the Borbon Henry of Navarre ascended to the throne when the sitting

200
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:23,700
King Henry the third was assassinated in 1589. But this was pretty awkward, because Henry of Navarre

201
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:29,070
was a Protestant, and he found himself unable, for example, to enter fiercely Catholic Paris.

202
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:35,430
But the now King Henry the fourth was a practical guide, so he converted to Catholicism to consolidate

203
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:41,400
his hold on the kingdom, though he did also promulgate the famous Edict of not, which granted religious

204
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:48,550
toleration if not religious freedom.In 1610, Henry the fourth was assassinated, and he was succeeded

205
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:54,640
by his 10 year old son Louis the 13th. And the early years of Louie the 13th reign was dominated by

206
00:19:54,640 --> 00:20:00,010
his mother Marie Domenici and featured among other things, the last calling of these Dates general and

207
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:07,390
1614. That is the assembly of the three estates. When Louie the 13th came of age, though power passed

208
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:12,580
into the hands of his principal minister Cardinal Richelieu, who we all know is the villain from The

209
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:18,130
Three Musketeers, but who also steered France through the 30 Years War, and who began the process of

210
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:22,750
tightening royal authority over the often rebellious nobles out in the provinces.

211
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:27,520
Both Louie the 13th and Cardinal Richelieu died within about a year of each other.

212
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:32,740
And four year old Louie the 14th, ascended to the throne in 1643.

213
00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:39,340
Now, as most of you know, Louie The 14th is a pretty big deal.

214
00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:45,010
He would go on to rule for 72 years, the longest reign in the history of Europe, becoming along the

215
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:51,160
way, the greatest King in the history of France, you know, the Sun King, more than anyone else, it was

216
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:57,220
Louie the 14th, who created the final form of the osteon regime against which the revolution was eventually

217
00:20:57,220 --> 00:21:04,240
waged. During his minority, there was a fairly massive noble revolt called the frond, which the Kings

218
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:10,810
forces managed to win. But when Louis the 14th began to rule in his own name, he accelerated the process

219
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:16,450
of political centralization started by recently, culminating most famously with his conversion of a

220
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:20,830
royal hunting lodge outside of Paris, into the Palace of Versailles.

221
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:28,600
The idea behind this new palace was to both physically project the image of royal power, but more importantly,

222
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:34,600
to force all those nobles who had been causing him trouble from their home provinces to come to Versailles

223
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:40,720
and attend to him cut off from their natural basis, and plied with lavish gifts and favours.

224
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:47,770
Louie the 14th completely domesticated the aristocracy, who now jostled over seats at the theatre, undermine

225
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:53,050
each other with petty gossip, and agonised over who would get to stand where, when the king woke up

226
00:21:53,050 --> 00:22:01,900
in the morning. Over his long reign, Louie the 14th spent money without restraint at home, off simultaneously

227
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:08,590
immersing France in a series of war abroad. So it's clear that the origins of the persistent royal deficits

228
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:13,900
that would dog and then consume his successors got going during the heady days of the Sun King.

229
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:21,550
But that said, When Louie the 14th, died in 1715, France was basically now the foremost Kingdom in Europe

230
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:25,030
was cultural and political influence was second to none.

231
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:29,889
This is when practically every court in Europe starts speaking the French language, adopting French

232
00:22:29,889 --> 00:22:34,120
fashions, and following French artistic and architectural tastes.

233
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:40,450
Louis the 14th live so long that he outlasted not only his son but his grandson.

234
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:45,250
And so it fell to his five year old great grandson Louie the 15th to succeed him.

235
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:49,960
And yes, that is the third time in a row, the French crown has fallen to some little kid.

236
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:56,230
As Louie the 15th grew up, it became clear that not only did he not have much interest in being king,

237
00:22:56,230 --> 00:23:03,100
but he wasn't very good at it either. For our purposes, his main achievement was to form an alliance

238
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:07,180
with France his longtime nemesis, the Austrians in 1756.

239
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:12,670
This Alliance led to the Seven Years War, a war in which France paid through the nose for the privilege

240
00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:16,780
of getting kicked around by the British. And as if that wasn't bad enough.

241
00:23:17,050 --> 00:23:21,490
When the French came out the other side of this expensive debacle, they found themselves still tied

242
00:23:21,490 --> 00:23:26,650
to the hated Austrians, which will become an important bone of contention when the revolution gets going.

243
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:33,760
Generally speaking, the nearly 60 year long reign of Louis the 15th was marked by political and economic

244
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:39,430
malaise. There were problems that needed answers, policies that needed reforming and courses that needed

245
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:46,150
correcting and basically nothing was done. But the reign of Louis the 15th, was also marked by the full

246
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:52,540
flowering of the French enlightenment, and a fantastic explosion of philosophy and literature and science.

247
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:58,780
And we'll talk about these duelling trends of political stagnation and intellectual vigour next week

248
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:03,820
when we start laying the groundwork for the looming, but not at all inevitable French Revolution.

249
00:24:06,610 --> 00:24:12,070
So that brings us finally to our man Louie the 16th, the grandson of Louie the 15th.

250
00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:16,570
He ascended the throne in May 1774, at the age of 19.

251
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:21,490
still young, but he did manage to break the streak of five year olds ruling friends.

252
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:27,610
Though pretty much everyone agrees that his heart was in the right place, and he genuinely wanted to

253
00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:31,310
do right by his people.He was ill prepared for the role of king.

254
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:38,000
He was bright and athletic, at least in his youth, but he was also shy and uncomfortable in the spotlight.

255
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:44,600
Unfortunately for him, the system set up by Louie the 14th basically created the brightest spotlight

256
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:50,900
imaginable for him to step into. His father had died when he was 11, which left him the heir to the

257
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:56,390
throne. And though he received a standard upper class education in the humanities, he was for whatever

258
00:24:56,390 --> 00:25:01,730
reason, not given much instruction in the practical Business of how to effectively rule a giant kingdom.

259
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:07,130
When he was 15 he was married to the 14 year old Austrian archduchess.

260
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:14,540
Marie Antoinette, repairing that for a good long time was uncomfortable socially, emotionally and physically.

261
00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:20,840
And it was genuinely unpopular and the source of great public and private mockery didn't help.

262
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:26,360
Marie Antoinette was an Austrian. And by the time they were married in 1770, every Frenchman with an

263
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:31,760
ounce of patriotism wanted to run the Austrians through with a hot poker, not marry their daughters.

264
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:40,010
Now, as I said, When Louie the 16th, ascended to the throne in 1774, he was an amiable if hesitant Prince,

265
00:25:40,370 --> 00:25:45,410
who was not opposed at all to trying to solve some of the problems that had built up over the last century.

266
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:52,040
But as we will see, one of the biggest obstacles to reform was that as much as pre revolutionary France

267
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:58,640
is depicted as an absolute monarchy, it was in fact, not that at all, and everywhere you turn, there

268
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:03,650
were entrenched interests, ready to fight for their ancient privileges, whatever those interests and

269
00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:10,670
privileges turned out to be. That resistance to change only exacerbated all the other issues facing

270
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:17,150
the new king. Next week, we will methodically walk through the list the completely backward tax structure,

271
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:24,260
the endemic social inequality, a judicial system that price privilege over justice, administrative jurisdictions

272
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:30,500
that overlapped haphazardly, a church that gobbled up money and seemed to give nothing back an outmoded

273
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:36,890
and inadequate agricultural economy. An educated class steeped in enlightenment ideals, who could see

274
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:40,820
what needed to be done, and then watched in frustration as nothing got done.

275
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:47,720
At least until it was revealed that the monarchy was on the brink of financial ruin.
