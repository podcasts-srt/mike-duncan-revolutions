00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:21,010
Hello, and welcome to revolutions Episode 30. The critical period we left off last time with the aborted

2
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:26,830
Newberg conspiracy hatch between disgruntled continental officers and disgruntled members of Congress

3
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:30,580
to strong arm the several States into granting the national government more power.

4
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:36,520
But though George Washington smack the conspiracy down before it even got off the ground, that did not

5
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:42,460
mean he didn't agree with them, years of trying to wrestle supplies from obstinate states and an ineffectual

6
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:47,230
Congress had convinced him that a strong central government was essential to the long term survival

7
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:54,850
of an independent United States. It was the mean he disagreed with not the ends, and those ends became

8
00:00:54,880 --> 00:01:00,130
even more obviously needed as the new country tried to get itself up and running in the 1780s.

9
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:06,190
The years between the end of the war and the ratification of the Constitution, have long been known

10
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:11,800
to scholars as the critical period, period during which internal and external pressures threaten to cross

11
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:17,440
the newly independent United States. Now, more recently, historians have decided, it might not be quite

12
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:21,640
as melodramatic as that, but it was a time of political and economic uncertainty.

13
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:26,620
And As the years passed, it became clear and clear that the Articles of Confederation were part of the

14
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:34,420
problem, not a part of the solution. To start with the big picture, the leaders of the new United States

15
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:39,790
immediately found themselves swimming in the deep end of international waters, and no one much interested

16
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:45,550
in helping them stay afloat. France and Spain and Holland had all been happy to buoy the Americans while

17
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:51,340
the war with Britain was on. But now that the European powers had succeeded in their real politic objective

18
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:55,900
of dismembering the British Empire, hey, you want it to be independent? Well, now you're independent.

19
00:01:56,620 --> 00:02:01,210
The Dutch bankers were hesitant about lending more money to a congress that had literally no way to

20
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:06,250
pay them back. The French called Thomas Jefferson, the new American ambassador in Paris, that they were

21
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:11,290
happy to trade with the United States when and where it suited them, but only when and where it suited

22
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:16,210
them. These were still the heady days of mercantilist economic theory, or the point was to create a

23
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:21,340
closed system of colonial trade that benefited the mother country, not an open system of international

24
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:24,640
trade that might, God forbid benefit a rival nation.

25
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:30,220
The Spanish as we'll see, in a minute, were deeply concerned about an expanding United States pushing

26
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:32,980
them off their North American foothold along the Gulf Coast.

27
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:41,860
So yes, allies and war rivals in peace. Then, of course, there was the British, who adopted a posture

28
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:44,950
of studious contempt towards their emancipated children.

29
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:49,150
john adams arrived as the first American ambassador to the court of St.

30
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:55,300
James and found himself alternatively ignored, dismissed or laughed at, depending on which door he happened

31
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:59,470
to be knocking on the British plan to make the Americans learn the hard way.

32
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:05,140
What independence really meant. American consumers were free to purchase all the British goods they

33
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:08,890
wanted. Knowing that American consumers were desperate for British goods.

34
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:13,960
This had the effect of destroying whatever burgeoning local manufacturing had grown up in the United

35
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:19,570
States during the war years, then all the British ports in the West Indies were closed to American export,

36
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:23,260
which was fairly devastating to the New England economy in particular.

37
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:29,410
The only way to combat these economic attacks was to put up a united front as the colonies had so ably

38
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:31,930
done when combating the Stamp Act and the Townsend acts.

39
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:35,440
But that solidarity was nowhere to be found in the 1780s.

40
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:40,540
Each state tried to work out its own deal with the British and all to Britain's advantage.

41
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:47,380
I'll wrap up this global outlook by coming back around to the Spanish because the trouble was Spain

42
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:52,090
will segue nicely into a discussion of kind of internal tensions that threaten the cohesion of the new

43
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:59,380
United States. In the Treaty of Paris negotiations, Britain had given Spain all of Florida and the Spanish

44
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:04,630
now enjoyed a claim to pretty much the entire Gulf Coast, including all ports in the Mississippi Delta.

45
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:10,240
The Spanish, though were none too happy about the boundary lines of the new United States worked out

46
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:15,010
between the British and Americans, which granted the US lands reaching all the way to the Mississippi,

47
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:17,950
which they did not believe was really Britain's to concede.

48
00:04:19,090. --> 00:04:23,920
to combat the spread of American settlers. They closed up the Lower Mississippi to American economic

49
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:30,310
traffic in 1784. This was of course a stab at the juggler of migrants moving into what is now mostly

50
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:35,800
the states of Kentucky and Tennessee. Their economic livelihoods depended on trading down the river

51
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:41,020
rather than back overland to the Atlantic. So much so that the Spanish even started offering these new

52
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:46,090
settlers access to the river if they agreed to renounce the United States and incorporate themselves

53
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:52,810
as part of the Spanish Empire at the time, and at that moment, this was not as far fetched a proposal

54
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:59,720
as it might seem today.All of this of course, set off a diplomatic kerfluffle that saw the Americans

55
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:04,220
disappear JOHN j of New York to work out a treaty with Spain that would resolve the crisis.

56
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:09,800
Jays talks with the Spanish went smoothly. But for leaders of the southern states, they went a little

57
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:15,140
too smoothly, because j seemed inclined to just give the Spanish everything they wanted and call it

58
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:20,870
a day. This the southern leader suspected was because Jay was not representing the United States.

59
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:25,850
So much as he was representing Northeastern commercial interests who feared the rising power of the

60
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:31,640
West. Those commercial interests wanted to make sure that all financial and political power stayed where

61
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:37,280
it belonged on the eastern seaboard, or Western economy built off the Mississippi rather than the Atlantic

62
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:40,010
would threaten that economic and political monopoly.

63
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:45,740
But though Jay signed off on terms that would in fact, close the Lower Mississippi to American economic

64
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:50,900
traffic, it didn't really matter because the Articles of Confederation required nine of 13 states to

65
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:56,060
ratify a treaty, and the southern states were never going to ratify this treaty in a million years,

66
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:59,510
because they were the ones who stood to gain the most from Southwestern expansion.

67
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:06,980
So as I said, these dealings with the Spanish expose the internal tensions that were working to divide

68
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:11,360
the union, north and south on the one hand, east and west on the other.

69
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:17,180
The north south question will, of course, become the defining tension of the United States and ultimately

70
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:21,830
result in the Civil War, because what's going on here is that two very different political economies

71
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:26,420
are being grafted together a commercial northeast that will soon become an industrialised commercial

72
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:29,720
northeast, and an agrarian South built on slave labour.

73
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:35,450
What was good for one often turned out to be bad for the other, especially as the North turned its back

74
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:41,360
on slavery both for economic and moral reasons, or the South dug in its heels even harder.

75
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:48,500
The other great tension that threatens to undermine American unity was the divide between East and West.

76
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:54,080
the interests of the rich coastal cities really did not align with those of the inland farmers.

77
00:06:54,409 --> 00:06:58,430
And as we'll see in a minute was Shay's rebellion, like, really, really not aligned.

78
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:02,960
With the Treaty of Paris guaranteed that the future of America lay to the west.

79
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:07,850
The question was how those lands would be divided up and incorporated into the United States.

80
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:13,880
And then how much say would Western settlers get in how the national government was run? as we just

81
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:19,370
saw, there were powerful little cliques in New York and Boston and Philadelphia, who thought it perfectly

82
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:21,830
right that they would continue holding all the power.

83
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:27,110
But in grappling with the question of what to do with the West, the Congress of the Confederation enjoyed

84
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:33,890
its one major success, because the resulting Northwest Ordinance wound up serving as the permanent model

85
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:37,640
of how territories would be divided up and integrated into the United States.

86
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:42,560
And yes, coastal elites, you are going to have to share with the other children.

87
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:50,300
The first issue was whether those territories would remain mere territories in perpetuity, or whether

88
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:53,240
they would eventually be admitted as full and equal states.

89
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:57,289
Now, we just sort of take the whole path to statehood for granted today.

90
00:07:57,590 --> 00:08:01,789
But it's worth remembering that at the time, there was basically no precedent for this.

91
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:07,640
When a sovereign nation created a colony or claimed a territory, those colonies and territories remained

92
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:12,800
colonies and territories forever. And despite everything that had just happened in the last 20 years,

93
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:17,570
there were quite a few American leaders, who naturally assume that the western territories would remain

94
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:21,530
territories governed by the real estates along the Atlantic seaboard.

95
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:28,460
But two other and dare I say wiser leaders, this seemed like a recipe for simply replaying the revolution,

96
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:33,110
a generation or two down the road. Only this time, we'll get to be the evil British, and they'll get

97
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:39,230
to be the scrappy colonial underdogs. So it was decided that the Northwest Territories would be surveyed,

98
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:44,810
divided up into a reasonable number of chunks. And when those chunks hit 60,000 residents that they

99
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:50,780
could apply for statehood, a process that got rolling in earnest in 1803, and eventually saw the new

100
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:55,970
states of Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, Illinois, and Wisconsin admitted to the union.

101
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:00,590
Part of Minnesota is in there too, but it took the Louisiana Purchase to fill them out.

102
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:07,760
During the debate over the Northwest Ordinance, the tension between North and South and East and West

103
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:12,020
coincided over the increasingly all important issue of slavery.

104
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:17,240
Because slavery wound up being forbidden in the Northwest Territories.

105
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:21,890
Mostly, settlers who already had slaves were grandfathered in.

106
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:26,000
There was no mention of whether slavery would be legal once a territory became a state.

107
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:31,010
And the first iteration of the fugitive slave law was written into guarantee that runaway slaves would

108
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:35,780
be returned to their rightful owners, if that's not the most heinous contradiction in terms I can think

109
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:42,350
of. But other than that, no buying or selling or importation of slaves would be allowed in these new

110
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:48,110
territories. And this is a pretty momentous decision, as it ensure that the dividing line between the

111
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:52,010
free north and the slave South would be extended to the Mississippi River.

112
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:57,360
The southern states apparently went along with this partly because they were afraid of economic competition

113
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,570
from the New Territories if they were allowed to eat slave labour.

114
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:06,900
The future however, the South would be far less willing to grant those kinds of legal precedents and

115
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:12,330
the battles over whether slavery would be allowed or not in new territories and States became the running

116
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:15,480
political battle that eventually exploded into the Civil War.

117
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:22,590
So the Northwest Ordinance was a pretty good piece of legislation for Congress, and historians generally

118
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:28,440
conceded to be their one enduring achievement. Though, if you were an American Indian living in those

119
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:33,660
territories, wow, you probably don't think the Northwest Ordinance is so hot seeing is how it's basically

120
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:38,070
dividing up all your land into neat little boxes in handing it over to a bunch of white guys.

121
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,490
Not the Congress just ignored the rights of Indians.

122
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:46,530
And they wrote in an article to the Northwest Ordinance that I'm going to quote in full because of the

123
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:54,600
dark irony contained there in the utmost good faith shall always be observed towards the Indians, their

124
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:59,550
lands, and property shall never be taken from them without their consent, and in their property rights

125
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:06,030
and liberty. They shall never be invaded or disturbed unless injust and lawful wars authorised by Congress.

126
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:11,370
But laws founded in justice and humanity shall from time to time be made for preventing wrongs being

127
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:15,540
done to them, and for preserving peace and friendship with them.

128
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:25,200
Which, yeah, that's not how it went at all. This one success aside, though, the Articles of Confederation

129
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:30,000
were just not working. And it didn't help that the only people treating the national government of the

130
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:36,090
United States worse than the British was the states themselves, most outright ignored Congress.

131
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:41,400
And if they bothered to send representatives at all the men they sent or second or third tier leaders

132
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:47,340
who were more or less being sent into Political exile, the states built their own navies that unilaterally

133
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:52,560
fought Indians. They tried to make commercial treaties with foreign powers, all the stuff that was supposed

134
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:58,170
to be the purview of Congress, all that, and they refuse to send Congress any of the money they had

135
00:11:58,170 --> 00:12:04,560
promised. All of this, to be blunt, threaten the very existence of this thing called the United States

136
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:13,110
of America. In the end, all hope for the survival of Congress lay with reviving that 5% in post we talked

137
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:19,170
about last week, if that one little piece could be put in place, that maybe things would work out.

138
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:24,750
Though the tactic of using the military to gain leverage over the state had failed.

139
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:30,569
The men interested in a solvent national government, one of whom we'll talk about in a moment, did not

140
00:12:30,569 --> 00:12:34,470
give up. For more than two years, they kept pushing for the amendment.

141
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:40,260
And one by one the various states agreed that Yes, fine, you can have your imposed, though usually there

142
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:43,800
was a slew of concessions and exceptions that had to go along with it.

143
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:47,760
But then that sticky business of unanimity popped up again.

144
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:51,600
The first time the imposed had been floated back in 1781.

145
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,090
It had been killed because Rhode Island didn't want to ratify.

146
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:59,610
This time around it languished for want of support in both Pennsylvania and New York.

147
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:05,190
American creditors, both home and abroad were strung along for more than two years on the promise that

148
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:07,830
the inpost would eventually be passed and they would get their money.

149
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:16,530
But by 1786, both New York and Pennsylvania refused to ratify the inpost was dead, and Congress was

150
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:27,620
essentially bankrupt.Sowhat do we do now? One of the guys trying to figure out what to do now was Alexander

151
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:32,420
Hamilton, who was about to make his way to the forefront of American history, where he will either be

152
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:37,520
treated as a visionary hero or an evil villain, depending on whose side of history you happen to be

153
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:45,200
reading. Hamilton had been born in an indeterminate date in the mid 1750s, down on the Leeward Islands,

154
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:51,380
then part of the British West Indies. orphaned in the 11 to 13 range, the young Hamilton worked as a

155
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:56,390
clerk and an import export firm until the local elites notice that this bright young man was actually

156
00:13:56,390 --> 00:14:02,540
something of a prodigy. So they took up a collection in 1772, to send him up north for proper education.

157
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:08,630
After some secondary schooling in New Jersey, Hamilton wound up at King's College, which is now Columbia

158
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:14,660
University. As political tensions mountain young Hamilton was a vocal supporter of the Patriot cause

159
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:19,220
publishing rebuttals to Tory arguments both anonymously and under his own name.

160
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:24,530
When the war finally did break out, he immediately joined a New York militia regiment made up of other

161
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:29,900
King's College students. This regiment conducted a quick raid on a British battery and took home some

162
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:35,540
artillery pieces, which is how the regiment became an artillery regiment, and how Hamilton became an

163
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:41,630
artillery officer. He served throughout the campaign to New York and as I was able to briefly mention

164
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:45,200
man, one of the batteries that kept the hessians pinned down at the Battle of Trenton.

165
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:52,370
After Trenton though, he came to the attention of the senior staff, including Nathaniel Greene and rhinox,

166
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:58,520
who recognised his brilliance. But unfortunately, these guys wanted Hamilton for their staffs, not to

167
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,620
command troops in the field. Which is what he wanted.

168
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:05,210
So Hamilton kept turning down requests until he got one he couldn't turn down.

169
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:08,540
George Washington asked him to serve as his secretary.

170
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:15,080
And Hamilton couldn't say no. He spent the next four years as Washington's de facto Chief of Staff,

171
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:19,580
handling correspondence, drafting orders, organising logistics, everything.

172
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,360
But Hamilton was an ambitious kids still in his mid 20s.

173
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:25,970
And he didn't want to go down in history as a paper pusher.

174
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:31,069.
By 1781. Hamilton was sick of being Washington secretary and he wanted out.

175
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:36,530
And there's plenty of evidence that Washington was not really an easy guy to work for, and praise for

176
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:40,640
his personal greatness tends to diminish the closer you actually get to him.

177
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:47,090
Washington for his part, seemed ready to let Hamilton go, and they both decided to let a petty little

178
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:52,670
incident be an excuse for Hamilton to resign. Literally, it was about how long Washington had been kept

179
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:58,850
waiting at the top of a flight of stairs. The ill will though was not permanent, and Washington eventually

180
00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:03,980
granted his former secretaries repeated demands for a field command, and Hamilton served as a colonel

181
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:10,610
of infantry during the siege of Yorktown.After the war,Hamilton resigned from the army, and in 1782,

182
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:13,370
was appointed to the now Congress of the Confederation.

183
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:18,830
As I mentioned at the top of the show, Washington had been convinced by his wartime experience that

184
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:25,070
a strong central government was a must. Well, that was doubly true for Alexander Hamilton, especially

185
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:28,610
since he was the guy who had had to write all those letters begging for supplies.

186
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:36,230
And then wade through all the refusals. Hamilton had zero respect for the supposed virtues of voluntary

187
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:43,490
support. As the new bird conspiracy started bubbling up, he was one of those nationalist inclined representatives

188
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:46,880
who proud of the officer still in the Continental Army to take action.

189
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:52,010
And He even wrote a letter to Washington asking for the general support at this critical juncture.

190
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:59,150
But when the conspiracy failed, and the 5% impose looking like it was going nowhere fast, Hamilton resigned

191
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:04,339
from Congress and returned to New York to practice law, where he would remain until circumstances provided

192
00:17:04,339 --> 00:17:10,819
another opportunity to push for a stronger, for God's sakes at the very least solvent national government.

193
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:16,849
Which brings us to the Final Crisis of the critical period.

194
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:23,450
Shay's rebellion, because as it turned out, Congress who was not the only ones having trouble paying

195
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:31,370
their bills in the mid 1780s. out in rural Western Massachusetts, life was a bit different than it was

196
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:36,230
in the coastal cities. And as I mentioned, it was a perfect example of the tension between the urban

197
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:43,520
east and the rural West. families in the West live mostly a subsistence farming existence, using the

198
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:48,980
barter system, and lines of credit that would not really hold up to strict demands for repayment.

199
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,400
The war had not been easy on them. But the peace was proving to be positively brutal.

200
00:17:56,990 --> 00:18:01,700
A big part of their pain was a result of the new economic relationship between the British and Americans.

201
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:07,880
As I said, the British were happy to keep shipping goods to the colonies in the United States.

202
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:14,740
But the liberally extended credit had driedup, theBritish merchants now wanted hard currency from their

203
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:19,810
partners in for example, Boston, this dynamic was actually playing out all over the country, but we're

204
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:24,490
gonna keep the focus on Massachusetts hard currency that was tough to come by.

205
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:29,560
So the city merchants had to pass along the demand for hard currency to their inland distributors, who

206
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:34,960
had to pass it along to their customers. And if anyone had currency it sure as hell wasn't smallholder

207
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:40,330
farmers in western Massachusetts. But that didn't stop creditors from taking them to court and suing

208
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:46,270
for the money they were owed, or stopping the courts from issuing judgments that invariably went against

209
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:52,570
the farmers. Now, the one thing the farmers had going for them, though, was governor john Hancock.

210
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:58,990
Hancock's entire career had been built on his populist appeal, and he was winning annual elections to

211
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:06,250
the governorship with like 90% of the vote. So being popular and popular list, Hancock did not lift

212
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:10,690
a finger to help creditors retrieve their debt or enforce any court orders.

213
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:14,560
But by 1785, things were starting to get out of hand.

214
00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:20,170
There were so many uncollected and uncollectible debts, something was going to have to give.

215
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:25,540
And that's right when john Hancock suddenly got so sick that he had to resign from office.

216
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:31,930
The rumours swirled so loud that it's basically now taken for granted that Hancock resigned to avoid

217
00:19:31,930 --> 00:19:37,180
dealing with the looming political crisis, because it was down to either evict poor families from their

218
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:41,020
homes, or stiff, the wealthy and powerful merchants of Boston.

219
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:47,320
It was going to be a really tough decision. And so Hancock started coughing and slipped off to bed.

220
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:53,380
replacing him was a man who did not think that this decision was tough at all.

221
00:19:53,710 --> 00:20:00,250
James Boden. Boden was one of those wealthy and powerful merchants, and he was all for compelling repayment

222
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:05,050
of debt. The revolution had been about anything it had been about protecting property.

223
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:10,900
Money had been lent in good faith, and people couldn't just be allowed to walk away from it that road

224
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:16,660
led to anarchy. But then Bowden added fuel to the fire when he decided to get the state's financial

225
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:20,740
house in order by also demanding payment of all delinquent taxes.

226
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:26,320
This of course, went over like gangbusters among the totally broke Western farmers, who now had to deal

227
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,380
not only with debt collectors, but tax collectors.

228
00:20:31,389 --> 00:20:35,830
One of those farmers was a revolutionary war veteran named Daniel Shay's.

229
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:41,410
Shay's had been young farmhand when the war broke out, and after he signed up for service, he saw action

230
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:47,770
at Lexington and Concord, Bunker Hill, and then Saratoga, eventually wounded, Shay's resigned from the

231
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:53,860
service in 1780. And his compensation for his five years under arms he received nothing.

232
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:58,570
Then he returned home and started getting dragged into court for non payment of debts.

233
00:20:59,139 --> 00:21:02,830
This as you can imagine, fire day lid or something in the belly of Daniel Shays.

234
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:07,990
He was not the first man to call for resistance, nor was he the only man to call for resistance.

235
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:12,250
But he wound up the most prominent, until we call this little insurrection.

236
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:20,710
Shay's rebellion. The first instances of direct resistance started as early as 1782, when groups of

237
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:25,450
sympathetic neighbours would simply go take back property that had been seized from their poor friends.

238
00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:31,540
But though there was some wild talk at this point about taking up arms, for the moment, most were content

239
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:37,330
to petition the state government for help, specifically, requesting that the state issue more paper

240
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:43,480
currency, more paper currency would be not only that, hey, we'll have some money now, but also that it

241
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:48,820
would diminish the amount owed, as the resulting inflation would reduce the overall burden of payment.

242
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:53,470
Of course, the creditors out there wanted no part of this for the exact same reason.

243
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:57,370
And one of the leaders against the free money was, of course James Bowden.

244
00:21:57,910 --> 00:22:02,650
So when Bowden became governor, you can imagine what the farmers thought of their chances for relief.

245
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:10,300
things really got going in August 1786, when the state legislature adjourned without considering any

246
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:12,370
of the various petitions from the western farmers.

247
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:18,520
The response was immediate. Chase and the other leader settle on a plan to simply prevent local courts

248
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:25,240
from sitting, no court, no judgments. So on August the 29th, they mod the courthouse in North Hampton,

249
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:30,790
and prevented it from sitting. Then on September the fifth, a court was shut down by like minded farmers

250
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:37,270
in Worcester. These unconscionable acts of criminal anarchie led the Massachusetts Supreme Court to

251
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:43,240
hand down indictment of the leaders who promptly decided to try and shut down the Supreme Court to but

252
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:48,250
when Shay's led about 300 farmers to the courthouse, they were met by an equal number of state militia.

253
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:53,410
So all Shay's in his men did was demonstrate and parade around their strength before retiring.

254
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:58,690
Her early October, a more courts across the state were shut down.

255
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:03,760
And it was becoming clear to the political elites in Boston, that there was a serious armed rebellion

256
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:07,360
going on out in the West, stern measures needed to be taken.

257
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:14,280
Ironically, one of those who argued that stern measures needed to be taken was none other than Sam Adams.

258
00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:19,590
The one staunch populace was accused by his former friends of being a hypocritical sellout.

259
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:25,080
I mean, you remember the stunts we used to pull back in the day right? But Adam said that there was

260
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:31,320
no contradiction. rebellion against an unrepresentative monarchy was right and just rebellion against

261
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:36,390
a representative Republic, though was blatantly criminal, and all the leaders should be hanged.

262
00:23:37,770 --> 00:23:43,950
In late November, a group of about 300 defenders of this representative Republic road west to arrest

263
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:49,860
the leaders of the rebellion. They succeeded in nabbing a few, but only after a violent confrontation

264
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:55,440
that further radicalise the farmers, who were now agreeing that it was time to overthrow the tyrannical

265
00:23:55,440 --> 00:24:01,860
state of Massachusetts. So yeah, it's kind of amazing how fast you can go through the looking glass

266
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:09,150
once the revolutionary ball gets rolling. The national government was of course unable to lift a finger

267
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:12,300
to help put down this armed insurrection within their borders.

268
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:17,790
They had no money to raise troops, and even the state of Massachusetts was having trouble so the hat

269
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:22,680
had to be passed around the wealthy elite, until a private militia of 3000 men was raised.

270
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:28,290
Put at the disposal of former continental general Benjamin Lincoln, he of the siege of Charleston.

271
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:33,840
Meanwhile, Shea's and his comrades were rapidly forming their ranks into organised units.

272
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,960
Their first target was a natural one, the Federal armoury in Springfield.

273
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:43,870
But before they could get to it, a contingent of state militia occupied it, all of which was terribly

274
00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:47,320
embarrassing for Congress, since it was technically a federal armoury.

275
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:52,330
And they couldn't defend it, or frankly, stop the Massachusetts militia from simply taking it over.

276
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:59,950
I mean, really, at this point, is there even such a thing as the United States of America The rebel

277
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:04,690
farmers plan to hit the armoury from three sides on January the 25th 1787.

278
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:10,240
But one of the groups was held up in the frantic message to delay the attack was intercepted.

279
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:15,490
So the other two columns numbering about 1500 moved in without further backup.

280
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:21,190
When they arrived at the armoury, the militia inside fired shots over their heads to warn them off.

281
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:27,100
And then the militia fired grapeshot from a cannon right into them, killing three and wounding about

282
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:33,640
20 others. The rest scattered before regrouping and amhurst when news of the armoury incident filtered

283
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:37,450
back east, Benjamin Lincoln led out his 3000 men in pursuit.

284
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:41,200
Shay's and his comrades managed to keep a safe distance.

285
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:45,790
But on the night of February the third link in order to force march to surprise the rebels that their

286
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:51,640
temporary camp, there wasn't much killing and only a few prisoners were taken, but it did break the

287
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:56,020
cohesion of the rebellion. And that was really the last large scale action.

288
00:25:57,370 --> 00:26:02,200
At the end of February, the short enlistment of Lincoln's private militia expired and most went home.

289
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:07,660
The scattered rebels either went home themselves or tried to carry on the fight in small bands.

290
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:14,290
The last little kick came on February the 27th. About 150 farmer started raiding towns and were met

291
00:26:14,290 --> 00:26:20,410
in Sheffield by at state militia sharp firefight broke out that's odd dozens wounded on both sides.

292
00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:26,320
As the rebellion died down, Governor Bowden imposed harsh terms on known rebels.

293
00:26:26,890 --> 00:26:31,840
But this proved to be an unpopular move. And john Hancock suddenly feeling much better now.

294
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:37,540
Thank you was able to ride back in trounce Bowden in the next election and start granting pardons for

295
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:41,710
the 4000 or so men who admitted taking some part in the insurrection.

296
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:48,160
Daniel Shays himself was convicted and sentenced to death, but he was pardoned in 1788 and was later

297
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:53,920
granted a small pension by the federal government for his wartime service, dying in 1825 at the ripe

298
00:26:53,920 --> 00:27:02,740
old age of 78. Now, there is not a direct correlation between Shay's rebellion and the almost simultaneous

299
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:05,889
call for a convention to rewrite the Articles of Confederation.

300
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:10,389
But it certainly helped nudge any fence sitters in the direction of Yeah, okay.

301
00:27:10,389 --> 00:27:14,139
It's not like the states are doing such a bang up job with their newfound powers.

302
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:19,660
And what would be so bad about strengthening the national government a little not that everyone was

303
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:22,540
so squeamish about the prospect of future insurrections.

304
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:28,420
Reflecting on Shay's rebellion later the next year, Thomas Jefferson issued his now famous or infamous

305
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:34,060
quote, that in his view, a little rebellion now and again was good for the soul, that the tree of liberty

306
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:38,350
must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants.

307
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:45,400
It is its natural manure. By the time he was issuing this, quote, The newly drafted Constitution of

308
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:48,160
the United States was already making the rounds for ratification.

309
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:54,820
Because before Shay's rebellion even got going, leaders in Jefferson's own home state of Virginia initiated

310
00:27:54,820 --> 00:28:00,100
a call for representatives from the several States to meet in Annapolis, Maryland, work out a commercial

311
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:05,470
agreement that would help solidify and rationalise the national economy and maybe make it competitive

312
00:28:05,470 --> 00:28:13,690
on the world stage. In September 1786, delegates from five states, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania,

313
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:19,180
Delaware, and Virginia, showed up in Annapolis, and when they started talking, wouldn't you know it,

314
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:24,790
they all agree that the Articles of Confederation were a big roadblock to economic and political maturity.

315
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:30,580
So without waiting for delegates from other states to show up and disagree with them, they signed a

316
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:36,490
statement drafted by New York delegate Alexander Hamilton, calling for a convention to revise the articles

317
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:43,510
to meet in Philadelphia in May 1787. a convention where the first thing that would be agreed to was

318
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:48,280
that the articles were hopelessly broken, and needed to be replaced by a whole new constitution.

319
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:55,030
Next week will be the last episode of our cycle on the American Revolution.

320
00:28:55,450 --> 00:29:00,670
And we will cover the final act of the revolutionary era, the crafting and ratification of the United

321
00:29:00,670 --> 00:29:06,970
States Constitution. After that, I will take my leave to prepare for the French Revolution, a revolution

322
00:29:06,970 --> 00:29:13,450
that made Thomas Jefferson rethink his attitude about just how much blood the tree of liberty really

323
00:29:13,450 --> 00:29:13,720
need
