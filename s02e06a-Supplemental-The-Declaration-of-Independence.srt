00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:07,210
Hello and welcome to revolutions.

2
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:16,290
Episode 20 to supplement
the Declaration of Independence

3
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:24,170
The unanimous Declaration of the
thirteen united States of America.

4
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,670
In Congress July 4th 1776.

5
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:33,970
When in the course of human events it
becomes necessary for one People to dissolve the

6
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:38,620
Political Bands which have connected them with another
and to assume among the powers of

7
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:43,540
the earth the separate and equal station to which
the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God

8
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:48,670
entitle them a decent respect to the
opinions of mankind requires that they should

9
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:51,520
declare the causes which impel
them to the separation.

10
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:57,850
We hold these truths to be self-evident that
all men are created equal that they are

11
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:02,560
endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable
Rights that among these are Life

12
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:07,840
Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness That
to secure these Rights Governments are

13
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,880
instituted among Men deriving their just powers
from the consent of the governed That

14
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:17,470
whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of
these ends it is the right of the

15
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:23,110
People to alter or to abolish it and
to institute new Government laying its foundation on

16
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:28,900
such Principles and organizing its Powers in such
form as to them shall seem most likely

17
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:30,820
to affect their Safety and Happiness.

18
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:36,610
Prudence indeed will dictate that Governments long
established should not be changed for

19
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:38,210
light and transient causes.

20
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:44,470
And accordingly all experience hath shown that
mankind are more disposed to suffer while

21
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:49,270
evils are sufferable than to right themselves by
abolishing the forms to which they are

22
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:56,110
accustomed. But when a long train of
abuses and usurpations pursuing invariably the same

23
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:02,200
Object evinces a designed to reduce them under
absolute Despotism it is their right it is

24
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:06,820
their duty to throw off such Government and
to provide new Guards for their future

25
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:12,610
security. Such has been the patient sufferance of
these colonies and such is now the

26
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:16,570
necessity which constrains them to alter
their former Systems of Government.

27
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:21,580
The history of the present King of Great
Britain is a history of repeated Injuries and

28
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:27,070
Usurpations all having in direct object the
establishment of an absolute Tyranny over

29
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:32,080
these States. To prove this let Facts
be submitted to a candid world.

30
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:38,710
He has refused his Assent to Laws the
most wholesome and necessary for the public good.

31
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:44,170
He has forbidden his Governors to pass
Laws of immediate and pressing importance unless

32
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:49,600
suspended in their operation tell his Assent should
be obtained and when so suspended he

33
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,430
has utterly neglected to attend to them.

34
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,320
He has refused to pass other Laws for
the Accommodation of large Districts of People

35
00:02:56,770 --> 00:03:01,510
unless those People would relinquish the Right
of Representation in the Legislature a

36
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:05,500
Right inestimable to them and
formidable to tyrants only.

37
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:12,040
He has called together Legislative Bodies
at Places unusual uncomfortable and distant

38
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:16,840
from the depository of their public Records for
the sole purpose of fatiguing them into

39
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,190
compliance with his measures.

40
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:23,920
He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly
for opposing with manly firmness his

41
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,660
invasions on the Rights of the people.

42
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:31,960
He has refused for a long time after
such dissolutions to cause others to be elected

43
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:37,810
whereby the Legislative powers incapable of Annihilation
have returned to the people at

44
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:42,970
large for their exercise the state remaining in
the meantime exposed to all the dangers

45
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:45,520
of invasion from without
and convulsions within.

46
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:51,730
He has endeavoured to prevent the population of
the state for that purpose obstructing the

47
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:55,900
Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners refusing
to pass others to encourage their

48
00:03:55,900 --> 00:04:00,370
migrations hither and raising the conditions
of new Appropriations of land.

49
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:06,160
He has obstructed the Administration of Justice
by refusing his Assent to Laws for

50
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,900
establishing Judiciary Powers.

51
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:14,320
He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone
for the tenure of their offices and the

52
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,390
amount and payment of their salaries.

53
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:23,110
He has erected a multitude of New Offices
and sent hither swarms of Officers to harass

54
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:25,360
our People and eat out their substance.

55
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:31,060
He has kept among us in times of
peace Standing Armies without the consent of our

56
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:37,360
legislatures. He has affected to render the
Military independent of and superior to the

57
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:43,060
civil power he has combined with others to
subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our

58
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:48,910
constitution and unacknowledged by our laws giving
his Assent to their Acts of pretended

59
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:54,730
Legislation For quartering large Bodies of Armed Troops
among us For protecting them by a

60
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:59,740
mock Trial from Punishment for any Murders which
they should commit on the Inhabitants of

61
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:05,410
these States For cutting off our Trade with all
parts of the world For imposing Taxes on

62
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:11,500
us without our Consent For depriving us in many
cases to the benefits of Trial by Jury

63
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:18,040
For transporting us beyond the seas to be
tried for pretended offenses For abolishing the

64
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:22,290
free System of English Laws in the
neighboring province establishing there in an

65
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:27,360
arbitrary government and enlarging its Boundaries so as
to render it at once an Example

66
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:33,480
and fit instrument for introducing the same
absolute rule into these Colonies For taking

67
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:39,060
away our Charters abolishing our most valuable
Laws and altering fundamentally the Forms

68
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:44,280
of our Governments For suspending our
own Legislatures and declaring themselves invested

69
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:48,110
with Power to legislate for
us in all cases whatsoever.

70
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:54,420
He has abdicated Government here by declaring us
out of his Protection and waging war on

71
00:05:54,420 --> 00:06:00,600
us. He has plundered our seas ravaged our
Coasts burnt our towns and destroyed the lives

72
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:06,030
of our people. He is at this time
transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to

73
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:11,850
complete the works of death desolation and
tyranny already begun with circumstances of

74
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:18,180
Cruelty and Perfidy scarcely paralleled in the
most barbarous ages and totally unworthy

75
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:19,860
the Head of a civilized nation.

76
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:25,290
He has constrained our fellow citizens taken captive
on the high seas to bear arms

77
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:30,570
against their Country to become the executioners of
their friends and Brethren or to fall

78
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:32,370
themselves by their hands.

79
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:38,010
He has excited domestic insurrections among us
and has endeavoured to bring on the

80
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:43,950
Inhabitants of our frontiers the merciless Indian
Savages whose known Rule of Warfare is

81
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:52,650
an undistinguished destruction of all ages sexes
and conditions in every stage of these

82
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:57,240
oppressions we have Petitioned for Redress in
the most humble terms Our repeated

83
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:00,180
Petitions have been answered
only by repeated injury.

84
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:06,330
A Prince whose Character is thus marked by every
act which may define a Tyrant is unfit

85
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:07,890
to be the ruler of a free people.

86
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:12,690
Nor have We been wanting in
attentions to our British brethren.

87
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:17,070
We have warned them from time to time
of attempts by their legislature to extend an

88
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:19,110
unwarrantable jurisdiction over us.

89
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,470
We have reminded them of the circumstances
of our immigration and settlement here.

90
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,830
We have appealed to their native justice and
magnanimity and we have conjured them by the

91
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:34,560
ties of our common kindred to disavow
these usurpations which would inevitably interrupt

92
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:36,330
our connections and correspondence.

93
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:40,950
They too have been deaf to the
voice of justice and of consanguinity.

94
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:46,800
We must therefore acquiesce to the necessity
which denounces our Separation and hold them

95
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:55,630
as we hold the rest of mankind Enemies
in War in Peace Friends We therefore the

96
00:07:55,630 --> 00:08:00,700
Representatives of the United States of
America in general Congress assembled appealing

97
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:06,220
to the Supreme Judge of the world for the
rectitude of our intentions do in the name and

98
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:12,430
by Authority of the good people of these
Colonies solemnly publish and declare that these

99
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:18,520
United Colonies are and of Right ought to
be free and independent states that they are

100
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:22,930
Absolved from all Allegiance to the British
Crown and that all political connection

101
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:29,080
between them and the State of Great Britain is
and ought to be totally dissolved and that

102
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:35,140
as Free and Independent States they have full
Power to levy War conclude Peace contract

103
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:40,720
Alliances establish Commerce and do all other
Acts and Things which INDEPENDENT STATES

104
00:08:40,810 --> 00:08:41,860
may of right do.

105
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:47,830
And for the support of this Declaration with
a firm resilience on the protection of

106
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:54,790
divine Providence we mutually pledge to each other
our Lives our Fortunes and our sacred

107
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:55,120
Honor.
