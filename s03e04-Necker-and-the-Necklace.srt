00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:14,870
Hello, and welcome to revolutions Episode 3.4, neck hair and the necklace.

2
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,330
Last week we talked about the efforts of successive royal ministries in the early 1770s to reform some

3
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:27,700
of the more glaring problems with the Asan regime.

4
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:33,310
And we saw how those efforts were frustrated by those who stood to lose the most from reform, whether

5
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:38,290
they be aristocrats who weren't about to let their privileges be ignored, or peasant who weren't about

6
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:41,860
to let free market experiment literally take bread off their table.

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,880
With the failure of those reforms, the ministries of the late 1770s and early 1780s took a slightly

8
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:54,130
different approach to solving Francis problems. And though it would be an unfair exaggeration to say

9
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:57,040
that that approach was Hey, let's pretend like nothing's wrong.

10
00:00:57,730 --> 00:01:01,900
As you'll see that unfair exaggeration is not too far off the mark.

11
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:08,260
Once we get done talking about that, we're going to switch gears and trace the steadily declining reputation

12
00:01:08,289 --> 00:01:14,110
of Queen Marie Antoinette because that steadily declining reputation finally curse splattered for good

13
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:18,789
just as the Hey, nothing's wrong attitude was blowing up in the monarchies face.

14
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,700
So we left off with the ousting of the physiocrats reformer targo in May 1776.

15
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:31,190
As his reform package of spending cuts in the palace and free market economics out in the provinces

16
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:36,680
left him with a list of enemies a mile long, it wasn't hard to see that Turco would soon be on his way

17
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:43,310
out the door. So as the comptroller General's influence waned, one man positioned himself as the best

18
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:49,880
and frankly only candidate to replace him. Jacques Nick hair after tear go got the boot.

19
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:54,710
It would take the Kings advisors a good six months to get into care elevated into the ministry.

20
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:59,450
But when he was finally brought on board, everyone was convinced that he would be able to lead the Royal

21
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:03,710
Treasury out of danger and into the Promised Land of permanent solvency.

22
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,710
Now, one of the reasons it took a little while to get into care into the ministry was that he had three

23
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:17,280
pretty big strikes against him. He was a commoner, he was Swiss, and he was a Protestant.

24
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:23,340
Any one of those alone would have made him suspect to the inner circles of Versailles combined, they

25
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:27,960
would have torpedoed a lesser candidate, but netcare was no lesser candidate.

26
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:33,690
He was widely viewed as a financial genius who had the answers to all Francis problems.

27
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,340
Born in Geneva in 1732, and the care had been sent to Paris at the tender age of 15.

28
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:47,490
To work as a bank clerk for an uncle. It became apparent immediately that an aptitude for banking didn't

29
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:52,890
even begin to describe his talents. He worked his way quickly up the ranks and was made a full partner

30
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:59,100
in his uncle's bank just after turning 30. Now a wealthy young superstar in the world of finance, netcare

31
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:04,200
founded his own bank, and made even more money lending to the Royal Treasury and speculating in the

32
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:09,960
grain trade. Around the same time, he got involved with a wealthy widow, but when said wealthy widow

33
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:15,360
brought around a pretty Swiss girl named Suzanne Kirsch show, a carer fell in love with Suzanne, and

34
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:20,880
dropped said wealthy widow. interesting side note is that Suzanne had previously been engaged to none

35
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:25,410
other than Edward Gibbon, but the engagement was broken off when she took up with the care.

36
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:32,550
The couple was married and then had a daughter in 1766, named German, who met Omnicare raised on the

37
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:37,860
educational theories of Rousseau. And when she grew up, German became a literary celebrity in her own

38
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:42,840
right as Madame de stall, who waged a ceaseless intellectual war against Napoleon.

39
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:49,120
But now I'm starting to drift off topic. With the assistance and or prodding of his wife, Nick hair

40
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:54,730
started aiming for government office. In the late 1760s, he was appointed director of the East India

41
00:03:54,730 --> 00:04:00,400
Company, which like its British counterpart was a privately chartered corporation that held a legal monopoly

42
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:05,200
on the Indian trade markets. The company was failing badly from corruption and mismanagement.

43
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:11,079
And despite his efforts to maintain its independence, the company was liquidated in 1769, and all its

44
00:04:11,079 --> 00:04:16,720
assets and debts were taken over by the crown. But this will not be the last we've seen of the East

45
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:23,230
India Company. It will be reconstituted in 1785 and then be at the epicentre of a massive scandal in

46
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:30,580
1793. That was a big part of explaining when and why the revolution began to eat its own children, so

47
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:37,330
watch out for that. Returning to private business, then Macquarie spent the next few years building

48
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:43,180
up Jack's reputation as a financial wizard, mme Nick hair hosted a well attended salon, the top most

49
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:47,260
prominent intellectuals and government officials passed through at one point or another.

50
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:54,030
When Turco took over as Comptroller General in 1774, the carrier started publishing economic tracks

51
00:04:54,030 --> 00:05:00,810
that attacked the physiocrats reforms denouncing most especially the free trade in grain So by the time

52
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:05,730
tear go was driven from the Ministry, it was well known that Nikesh was sitting on a slate of ideas

53
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:09,840
that ran in the opposite direction to the discredited policies of the physiocrats.

54
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,050
Still, as I said, it took a few months to bring him in.

55
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:20,310
And even when he was brought in in October 1776, mcare had to take a less prestigious post because Protestants

56
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,450
were not allowed to hold a major office like Comptroller General of finances.

57
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,080
But whatever the title netcare was now more or less in charge of the Royal Treasury.

58
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:35,480
Like everyone else these days, he could see that taxes needed to be distributed a little more evenly

59
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:40,880
across the three estates. But being a banker, and the care was utterly convinced that actually raising

60
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:46,160
taxes was unnecessary, and that the Royal Treasury would be best served by floating more loans.

61
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:51,140
He was also in complete agreement with Virgin about the benefits of France getting into the American

62
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:54,860
war. And he scoffed at two NGOs complaints that they just couldn't afford it.

63
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:59,600
We won't even have to raise taxes. He said, we can just finance the whole thing and it'll be fine.

64
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:05,659
Trust me, I'm a financial genius, remember. So off he went to raise the money, offering good rates and

65
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:09,560
utterly self confident assurances that the Royal Treasury was in great shape.

66
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:14,720
On the strength of his personal reputation more than anything else, Nick hair, got his loans.

67
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:19,760
Even sceptics in the parliament only fought them a little bit on the first loan, and then started registering

68
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:26,660
future requests without complaint. Now trying to figure out exactly what Nick care was up to here is

69
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:31,250
a little tricky. And now I haven't got a good source on this, I would bet that he was interested in

70
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:36,650
taking France in the direction of the British, who when they created the Bank of England back in 1694,

71
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:41,060
more or less invented the idea of a permanent national debt serving as an engine for growth.

72
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:46,070
As long as the interest is being paid, the state would always have a ready supply of cash.

73
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:51,950
This would help explain decaires bookkeeping, without resorting to words like con artist, charlatan,

74
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:58,280
and complete fraud, because mcare started dividing royal expenditures up into two categories, ordinary

75
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:04,480
expenses and extraordinary expenses. As the loans piled up to fund the American warped netcare filed

76
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:10,720
the interest on those loans as ordinary expenses, but he dumped the principal off into extraordinary

77
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:15,160
expenses. He was happy to show anyone who asked the tally for the ordinary expenses.

78
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:20,530
And with those apparently in good order, no one thought to ask about the extraordinary expenses, which

79
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:25,210
would have sent potential lenders running for the hills rather than happily handing over more money.

80
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,820
The peak of knickers power, popularity and influence, at least on this first go around in the ministry

81
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:39,480
came in February 1781. When he convinced the king to let him publish for the first time ever a complete

82
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:46,500
accounting of the Royal finances. The resulting kontron do was meant to silence all critics and put

83
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:50,550
to rest any whispers that all was actually not well, in the king's pocket book.

84
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:57,180
The kontron do was a bonafide sensation, as nearly every educated man and woman in France wanted to

85
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:01,710
get a look at the king's books. I mean, this was an unprecedented lifting of the veil.

86
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:06,900
There were even mentions by later writers who were children at the time, that they literally learned

87
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:10,920
how to read from the kontron do it was seriously that big of a deal.

88
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:18,659
And what did it show? It showed that the Royal Treasury had a 10 million Libra surplus that this was

89
00:08:18,659 --> 00:08:24,420
because the comp Ron do only dealt with those ordinary expenses, the regular cost of government compared

90
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:29,700
to the regular streams of revenue. But as I just said things like you know, the massive load of loans

91
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:33,299
taken on to finance the war in America are just not even mentioned.

92
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:39,299
Had they been all France would have seen that the Treasury was actually running deep in the red.

93
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,280
In the long run, the legacy of the compound was not just that it swept Francis financial problems under

94
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:51,620
the rug, but that it became impossible to believe netcare successors when they revealed that the king

95
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:57,620
was not only broke, he was catastrophic Li broke. I mean, how do you convince someone who literally

96
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:02,600
learned how to read by flipping through the compound do that in less than five years, the monarchy had

97
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:08,420
somehow gone belly up. There were guys who right up until the end just couldn't believe it, and thought

98
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:13,310
that cologne was running some sort of Shakedown operation when he presented his reform package to the

99
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:20,720
assembly of notables in 1787. In the short term, though, the Comforter rendu led directly to netcare

100
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:26,690
getting himself kicked out of the ministry, believing that he was now indispensable, he demanded that

101
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:30,650
the king let him into the inner circle of decision makers or he would resign.

102
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,800
But like everyone in government in the care had his enemies, then they convinced the king not to bite.

103
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:42,410
His bluff called Macare had to make good on his threat, and he resigned in May 1781.

104
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:49,220
Though critically for future events, his popularity with the public only grew as he was martyred by

105
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:54,740
evil nobles who feared the influence of this commoner who the people of France had come to believe could

106
00:09:54,740 --> 00:10:04,290
do no wrong. netcare was succeeded by a guy JOHN Francois Zhu Li de Flurry, who was far more conservative

107
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:07,680
in his outlook, coming from a staunchly anti enlightenment family.

108
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:12,600
He's not of major importance, and his name will not be on the test.

109
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:15,660
But he was the bridge between netcare and Catalan.

110
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:20,490
And so I have to mention that Florrie took one look at the books and said, holy crap, we have got to

111
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:25,590
raise taxes. And thanks to his long standing connection to the parliament, he was able to push through

112
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:31,820
a third VA tm that would run through 1786. But the additional money raised was only going to cover interest

113
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:37,160
payments on all the previous loans. So just to keep going flurry had to borrow even more money, and

114
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:42,980
then go back to selling venal offices, a practice that had been slowly ratcheted down by previous ministries.

115
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:47,180
Given what he had to work with flurries days were always numbered.

116
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:52,490
I mean, how do you ask courtiers and ministers to cut back on spending and submit to new taxes when

117
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:56,000
the kontron do is sitting on their desk telling them that everything is fine.

118
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,550
He finally called it quits in March 1783. Just as negotiations to end the American War we're getting

119
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:10,520
underway. flurry was succeeded by a guy whose name will absolutely be on the test Sharla Alexandria

120
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:15,350
deck how long because it will be cologne who will spark the so called pre revolution.

121
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:20,450
When he finally gives up the ghost and says it's either major reforms or the kingdom collapses.

122
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:26,450
Those are your options. Unfortunately, as we'll see, cologne was not a particularly good messenger for

123
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:31,280
this dire warning, given his previous embrace of a little thing called useful splendour.

124
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:37,160
So as we'll see next week, when it came time for major reform, there was major pushback.

125
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,280
kalon had been born in 1734 in Flanders into a respectable family of the robe nobility.

126
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:49,740
He was trained as a lawyer and then slowly rose up through the political judicial ranks, serving in

127
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:54,510
the Flanders parliament and then securing positions in the central bureaucracy, and eventually rising

128
00:11:54,510 --> 00:12:00,270
up to be an intendant. Along the way, he earned a reputation as a man far more interested in nailing

129
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:03,930
down his next promotion than really doing the job that was in front of him.

130
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:09,510
But he was savvy in business and at least clever enough to always land that next promotion when it became

131
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:15,510
available. With the help of foreign minister version, who was by now Louise most trusted adviser, cologne

132
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:19,620
was brought in to serve as Comptroller General finances in November 1783.

133
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:25,380
And he brought with him the rather novel idea that the best way to get out of debt was to spend more

134
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:29,310
money. Now, this is crazy, of course, and it didn't work.

135
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:34,200
But cologne did have a plan. Like his predecessors Turco and Macare.

136
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:39,270
cologne believed that raising taxes was at least for the moment a political non starter.

137
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:44,880
his immediate predecessor, Florrie had pushed the limits of the nobilities patients by initiating the

138
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:50,310
third VA tm. Anything more that would require a concerted ro push that the ministry did not have the

139
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:55,800
stomach for, especially since it might eventually involve recalling the estates General, which was a

140
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,320
surefire way to completely lose control of the situation.

141
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:04,770
So cologne decided that the only way out was to keep borrowing and hope that maybe in time new loans

142
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:09,720
taken at lower rates would pay off the loans with higher rates, and then they could start getting ahead

143
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:15,660
of this thing. So instead of cutting back spending at Versailles, cologne conspicuously jacked it up.

144
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:20,700
The idea being that if creditors saw that the monarchy was spending lavishly, they would be assured

145
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:24,720
that the king was in good shape, and see more royal loans as a safe investment.

146
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:30,210
And for a while it worked. Its cologne took out hundreds of millions of Libra more in debt.

147
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:34,200
But even the useful splendour was not enough to quiet doubt.

148
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:40,590
And in December 1785, the Paris Parliament baulked at approving yet another loan, and they had to be

149
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:44,370
marched as a group to Versailles and basically ordered by the king to approve it.

150
00:13:44,819 --> 00:13:51,320
And so they did. But as you might guess, spending your way out of debt turned out to be not a very good

151
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:55,940
solution to the problem. Especially when cologne took to the books to survey the situation.

152
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:59,720
Now that flurries VA tm was set to expire at the end of 1786.

153
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:05,780
He was mortified to discover that the crown was about to start running an annual deficit of well over

154
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:09,890
100 million lever, which was a full quarter of expected revenue.

155
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:14,900
And it was only going to get worse as the interest started coming due for all the loans over the last

156
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:21,230
few years. Once those started kicking in something like half of all annual revenue was going to be going

157
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:26,330
to debt servicing. This was a grind the wheels to a halt revelation.

158
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:31,520
cologne realised that there could be no more tricks, no more kicking the can down the road.

159
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:36,440
The crisis everyone had been trying to avoid for the last decade was finally upon them.

160
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:42,470
And so he retired to his offices and started drawing up a plan to completely overhaul the Crown's finances.

161
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:48,020
A plan that would touch on almost every part of the ossian regime, a plan that would ruffle every feather

162
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:53,840
in the kingdom and a plan that the king would not be able to implement by his own royal will.

163
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,050
But we're going to leave the financial crisis there for the moment on the eve of cologne presenting

164
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:07,020
his reform package to the king. Because I want to close out today's episode by getting into a royal scandal

165
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:10,380
that would break just as all of this financial stuff was coming to a head.

166
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:16,260
It is a scandal too crazy to just breeze by without stopping to smell all the delicious details.

167
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:22,440
Plus, it offers the perfect opportunity to talk a bit about Maria Antoinette, who wound up losing whatever

168
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:27,870
popularity she had left as a result of the scandal, even though as we're about to see, she had nothing

169
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:34,590
whatsoever to do with anything. So let's talk about Maria Antoinette and the diamond necklace affair.

170
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:43,530
Maria Antoinette was born Maria Antonia in 1755. In Austria, the eighth child and youngest daughter

171
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:49,500
of Maria Teresa and Francis the first who were Holy Roman Empress, and Emperor respectively.

172
00:15:49,770 --> 00:15:54,720
And in that order, Maria Teresa having inherited the throne from her father in 1740.

173
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,110
Little Maria Antonia grew up in a fairly private and relaxed environment.

174
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:05,660
And though she never took much to formal education, she excelled at singing and dancing and seems to

175
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:12,210
have had a fairly happy childhood. But it just so happened that she was born right as Europe was undergoing

176
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:18,390
the diplomatic revolution of 1756, which we're going to talk about I think in two weeks, when we pull

177
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:22,830
back to survey the international scene within which the French Revolution is about to explode.

178
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:29,100
The diplomatic revolution meant that Austria had a whole new set of partners that needed to cement alliances

179
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:36,060
with including its longtime enemy France. It looked for a while like Maria Antonio wouldn't be called

180
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:38,580
upon to play a major role in the new alliance system.

181
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:41,760
But smallpox took its toll on the Australian royal family.

182
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:47,970
And by the time she turned 12, in 1767, negotiations were underway with the French to marry her to the

183
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:55,220
future Louie the 16th. himself just 13 years old. All the arrangements over the dowry and whatnot were

184
00:16:55,220 --> 00:17:01,070
finalised over the next few years. Maria Antonia was restyled Marie Antoinette and shipped over to the

185
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:06,170
custody of the French royal family, where she and Louie were officially married in May 1770.

186
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:13,790
Now, given that she was 14, and he was 15, and there was probably a roomful of people milling around

187
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:19,220
as was the weird royal custom. It is not surprising that the marriage was not consummated on the actual

188
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:25,400
wedding night. But as the days and then weeks, and then years passed, the missing act of consummation

189
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:31,310
became a mild concern than a running joke, and then a downright threat to the Franco Austrian Alliance.

190
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:34,430
Not that many in France were much concerned about that.

191
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:40,040
Though Murray herself was fairly popular in the early going the alliance with Austria was most assuredly

192
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:46,250
not, and that's up to an including Foreign Minister Virgin and King Louie himself, who both chafed under

193
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:49,550
an alliance and marriage that had been arranged by their predecessors.

194
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:56,190
So as the time passed, and Marie Antoinette continued to be ignored by King Louie who preferred hunting

195
00:17:56,190 --> 00:18:01,170
and tinkering with locks, she took comfort with a small circle of friends, and indulged in whatever

196
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:07,260
frivolities happened to present themselves shopping for clothes gambling, horse racing attention from

197
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:13,620
discrete male admirers. She was, after all, basically still just a kid, and was only 18 years old when

198
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:16,950
her husband ascended to the throne, and she became queen of France.

199
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:22,620
This title bumped changed a little for her though, including the constant barrage of letters from her

200
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:29,460
mother berating her for not having betted the king yet a harsh spotlight hit this failure of royal intimacy

201
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:32,460
when the king's younger brother had a son in 1775.

202
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:37,680
And by now, the gossipy underground press was having a field day and there were rumours that Louie actually

203
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:43,020
had a physical defect that eventually required surgery to fix, though that seems to have been just a

204
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:50,810
rumour. Finally, in 1777, Murray's brother Joseph, the second now Holy Roman Emperor, came to visit

205
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:54,560
and he was very much concerned about the state of the Franco Austrian Alliance.

206
00:18:55,220 --> 00:19:00,710
After badgering the couple to do their duty, the king and queen finally went to bed seven years after

207
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:06,840
they were married. But Marie Antoinette only enjoyed temporary relief from public mockery when their

208
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:14,070
first child turned out to be a daughter. But then in October 1781, she gave birth to the sun everyone

209
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:20,340
had been waiting for the last 11 years. Unfortunately, as we will see, the new dolphin that is the Crown

210
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:26,550
Prince was a sickly kid, and he would die at just about the worst possible moment in the spring of 1789.

211
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:32,040
A few years later, though, the royal couple had a second son, who would also come to a miserable end

212
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:37,170
at the hands of the evil revolutionaries, and then in 1786, a second daughter, who would not live to

213
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:44,440
see her first birthday. Now through all of this, Marie Antoinette continued to spend money by property

214
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:47,980
push for her own favourites to be given offices and pensions and gifts.

215
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:51,700
And her standing with the French public was not good at all.

216
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:56,650
She was just too frivolous and extravagant and out of touch, and she took a constant beating in the

217
00:19:56,650 --> 00:20:01,770
press. But up until the diamond necklace, affair which we're about to talk about.

218
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:06,390
She may have been the object of scorn and mockery, but it wasn't like she was hated.

219
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:11,850
And what's hilarious is that the thing that really got her hated was something that she had nothing

220
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:18,000
at all to do with. Okay, so the diamond necklace affair.

221
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:26,850
Here's how it goes. Way back in 1772 King Louie the 15th ordered an incredibly elaborate diamond necklace

222
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:31,800
from a Paris jeweller. It was meant to be a gift for his mistress, Madame Dewberry.

223
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:37,320
But the piece was so complex that it was not completed by the time the king died and but um Dewberry

224
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:40,050
was kindly asked by the royal family to take a hike.

225
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:45,540
The jeweler's now out the money they fronted to put the thing together tried to sell it to Marie Antoinette

226
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:52,110
in 1778. But she said no, it wasn't her style, and she wasn't too keen on but I am to bury herself.

227
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:57,570
So why would she want to wear her jewellery? After failing to sell the piece of bra the jewellers again

228
00:20:57,570 --> 00:21:02,490
tried the queen in 1781. And again, she said no. Okay, so far, so good.

229
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:05,700
There's a fancy necklace the Queen doesn't want it simple.

230
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:12,720
But here's where it starts to get complicated. along comes a con woman named john delamotte, who was

231
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,410
successfully passing herself off as a descendant of King Henry the second.

232
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:23,610
At some point in 1784. She and her husband and army officer who was also passing himself off as a noble

233
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:28,560
set their sights on fleecing the rich and hapless and hopefully pronounced correctly.

234
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:35,490
Cardinal de la Han, or Han was one of those wealthy aristocrats who made up the top level of the first

235
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:39,180
estate, and he had once upon a time been ambassador to Austria.

236
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:47,100
It was well known around town though that ohan A wanted a new position in the government, and B was

237
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:52,230
currently being iced out by the queen who did not approve of for Han reporting on her activities to her

238
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:55,560
mother, while the cardinal was serving as ambassador to Austria.

239
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:02,790
So our con woman john takes up with the good Cardinal and convinces him that she's developed an intimate

240
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:07,440
friendship with the Queen bait the gullible or Han could not pass up.

241
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:13,230
JOHN agreed to start delivering flattering notes from the cardinal to the queen, and then return with

242
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:16,800
the Queen's replies, replies that were of course forged.

243
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:22,290
These forts replies were apparently affection enough in tone that all Han started thinking maybe he

244
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:26,820
and the Queen had like something special. So he begged john to arrange a meeting.

245
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:33,150
No problem, says john and goes off and I'm not making this up to hire a prostitute who looked like the

246
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:39,360
queen. On a moonlit night in the gardens of Versailles, or Han and the fake prostitute Queen met and

247
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:45,700
promised to put all their bad blood behind them. Now, of course, while this is going on, john is routinely

248
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:50,950
taking money from pawn to invest in the Queen's charity work, which is a nice running scam.

249
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:55,240
But then along comes the jewellers with the huge diamond necklace they can sell.

250
00:22:55,630 --> 00:23:00,070
They have just found out that john has got the Queen's here, and they offer her a commission if you

251
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:07,510
can get it sold. So in January 1785, john forges a request from the queen to have Mohan buy it for her,

252
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:10,960
it would be too unseemly for me to go buy it myself, you see.

253
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:16,510
Jumping at the chance to serve the queen. The Cardinal arranges with the jewellers to buy the thing

254
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:19,900
for 2 million Libra to be paid off in four instalments.

255
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:25,000
He then takes the necklace and hands it off to the Queen's valet, who is of course just some guy in

256
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:30,280
cahoots with john and her husband. Ron is now absolutely giddy with the fine work he's done.

257
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:35,440
Not even suspecting for a moment the husband has just taken the necklace up to London, where he will

258
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,200
strip it and start selling the diamonds off one by one.

259
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:44,100
Eventually, though, Ron started to get nervous, and maybe a little suspicious, when he noticed that

260
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:48,960
the Queen had not yet worn the necklace, and still hadn't sent any of the money to pay off the jeweller

261
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,680
by the time the first instalment came due in August 1785.

262
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:00,300
When the payment deadline arrives, and john reveals to him that there's no money coming, the angry jeweller

263
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:05,400
goes directly to the queen. And the Queen says something along the lines of I don't know anything about

264
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:11,370
this and why are we still talking about this necklace? So the king and queen dragon will hon for an

265
00:24:11,370 --> 00:24:17,820
audience and demand and explanation. He tells them everything, and shows the forge purchase order which

266
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:21,390
sends King Louie into convulsions because it's obviously a forgery.

267
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:27,900
It was signed Marie Antoinette of France. And as a handful well knew the royalty only ever signed with

268
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:33,420
their given names. terminally pissed off, the king has bohan thrown in the steel.

269
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:38,820
And from there, the whole plot unravelled and everyone connected is hauled into court.

270
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:45,210
JOHN, the prostitute look alike, the forger the husband in absentia, since he's still up in London.

271
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:52,400
The trials were a sensation, one of those trials of the century that come along every few years.

272
00:24:52,850 --> 00:24:59,330
But in a crazy twist, the public chose to sympathise with the defendants, Cardinal vahagn had been duped

273
00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:05,070
simply Because he was too honest and eager, the prostitute was an innocent girl sucked into a sorted

274
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:11,370
world. Even john was painted as a sympathetic noble woman down on her luck who had been driven by poverty

275
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:17,280
to make bad choices. Everyone it seemed, was given a pass except the queen, who somehow came off as

276
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:23,010
a vindictive a harpy who had purposefully set the whole thing in motion to destroy Han, abscond with

277
00:25:23,010 --> 00:25:28,710
some pretty necklace, while all the while engaging in some fairly graphically depicted sexual manipulations.

278
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:33,380
And the actual judges appear to have picked through all of this well enough, john and her husband were

279
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:39,200
convicted. The forger was exiled. Cardinal dehaan was acquitted, and the Queen was found completely

280
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:45,080
innocent. But in the all important court of public opinion, the diamond necklace affair was devastating

281
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:48,620
to the Queen's and by extension, the entire monarchies reputation.

282
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:54,710
And what was really damning was just how easy it was to believe that she was this rotten, manipulative

283
00:25:54,710 --> 00:26:00,350
shrew who was all too eager to destroy anyone who stood between her and some shiny things.

284
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:06,590
It was a devastating public relations nightmare from which she would not recover, especially because

285
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:10,220
over the next few years, she would not have an opportunity to recover.

286
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:13,970
Things were about to go from bad to worse for the Austrian regime.

287
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:20,180
And next week, the public will be hit with the great bombshell that had been kept hidden for so long.

288
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:27,710
The Royal Treasury is exhausted and unless drastic measures are taken, the entire kingdom is going to

289
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:28,550
implode.
