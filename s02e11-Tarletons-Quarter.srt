This week's episode is brought to you by Harry's razors.

2
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:07,510
So you go to the drugstore to pick up some razors.

3
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:12,430
First, you have to find the guy who can open the case, then you have to wait around while he finds the

4
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:17,890
keys to the case. And then when the case finally gets open, your reward is paying 25 bucks for four

5
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:23,410
blades and some shaving cream. You leave muttering obscenities about the waste of time and money.

6
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:29,470
Such was the last straw for Andy, one of the co founders of Harry's razors, who was convinced that there

7
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:35,890
had to be a better way and there was focused on providing guys a great shaving experience where a fraction

8
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:41,170
of the price of the competition Harry's razors offers high quality blades engineered in their very own

German factory. Order online, it gets shipped to your home.

10
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:50,380
It's simple. I've got my own kit working for me as we speak, the blades are sharp, the razor design

11
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:57,190
is clean, which I like. And the cream is exactly what I need it to be no cuts, no irritation, it's great.

12
00:00:57,730 --> 00:01:02,230
And plus, I don't have to wait around for the guy with the keys just to pay way too much for it all.

15
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:40,450
Episode 27 Carlton's corner. Last week, the British turned the focus of the Revolutionary War South

16
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:46,900
first capturing Savannah, Georgia in 1779 and then taking Charleston, South Carolina in May 1780.

17
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:53,230
After taking these two key ports, the plan was to extend British influence inland and then move like

18
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:58,570
a wave up through North Carolina into Virginia, clearing out patriots and putting loyalists back in

19
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:04,600
charge. Now finally, in control of his own army, British General Charles Cornwallis was sure he could

20
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:09,940
take the Carolinas without too much difficulty. And according to the conventions of European war, his

21
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:15,670
campaign got off to a nearly flawless start. His forces quickly controlled a network of strategic strong

22
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:20,530
points across South Carolina, and then those we're about to see, he went the Continental armies and

23
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:26,680
to stop him without breaking a sweat. But despite these early successes, Cornwallis soon discovered that

24
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:32,320
these ignorant American rustics not having been educated properly at Oxford could not even do simple

25
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:37,630
math. triumph in the field plus control of all strong points is supposed to equal conquest.

26
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:42,340
Instead, the smart alec Americans had answered the triumph in the field plus control of all strong points

27
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:50,350
equals permanent ulcer. One of the big factors that led Cornwallis to develop this permanent ulcer was

28
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:55,390
the terrible paradox implicit in using force to put down a rebellion, because brute force only tends

29
00:02:55,390 --> 00:03:01,329
to make more rebels. So defeating these rebels militarily and winning them over politically, were all

30
00:03:01,329 --> 00:03:07,540
but mutually exclusive goals. He also had to deal with a loyalist population strong enough to hold the

31
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:13,750
tone in a bitter civil war that was breaking out in the Carolinas Civil War defined by small scale raid,

32
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:20,110
torching of houses, murders, run ins between neighbours, brutal skirmishes without quarter, there was

33
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:25,120
just no opportunity for Cornwallis to play the benevolent conqueror even if he had wanted to.

34
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:30,100
Both the Patriots and the loyalists were pretty well past being able to go back to the way things were

35
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:35,740
before the war. This little Civil War only picked up heat after the siege of Charleston, which put the

36
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:40,960
loyalists back in power and drove the Patriots to ground where they launched a guerrilla campaign that

37
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:46,480
did nothing but stymie, frustrate and ultimately undo the British dream of controlling the South.

38
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:53,710
On the Patriot side, the most famous leader of these irregular guerrilla forces was of course, Francis

39
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:59,620
Marion, the Swamp Fox. Many of you out there will remember that Disney produced a TV series about the

40
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:05,770
Swamp Fox back in the 1960s that is revered among Revolutionary War historians for its painstakingly

41
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:13,150
accurate portrayal Marian and his campaigns, I am sometimes told my humour is too dry, but I'll leave

42
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:19,330
it to you to judge. Marian was in his mid 40s, and then had learned his trade battling, often brutally.

43
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:24,610
So Cherokee Indians during the French and Indian War, slave owner like most of the other southern officers,

44
00:04:24,909 --> 00:04:30,340
he joined the South Carolina regiment of the Continental Army as a captain 1775 and will soon promoted

45
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:35,970
to Colonel.Hewas present for the disastrous attempt to retake Savannah in 1779.

46
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:40,770
And only miss being captured at Charleston because he had left the city to recuperate from a broken

47
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:46,080
ankle. When the last of the Continentals were pushed out of South Carolina in May, which we'll talk about

48
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:51,810
in a second. Marian was practically the only officer left in the state, and he organised a small force

49
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:58,380
of no more than 100 volunteers to carry on the fight for how long and to what end they did not yet know

50
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:06,300
On the loyal aside, the most famous unit was the British Legion, a unit composed entirely of American

51
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:09,030
volunteers under the command of British Colonel Bannister.

52
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:15,240
tarlton. Carlton's Raiders as they were informally known were a ruthless and effective arm of the British

53
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:20,730
regular army, earning instant infamy in the Patriot presses for their conduct during the Battle of whack

54
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:26,970
saws, which soon became known as the waxhaw massacre, bought at the end of Maine near the North Carolina

55
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:31,980
border. The small battle ended with the Americans first refusing to surrender but then throwing down

56
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:34,740
their arms after being charged by Carlton's cavalry.

57
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:40,380
The gist of what follows is that the Americans offer the white flag Carlton's horse was shot out from

58
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:45,690
under him. And then Tarleton men started mowing down the surrendering Americans and methodically killing

59
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:52,350
wounded men as they lay prone in the field. accounts of the massacre, why it unfolded and to what extent

60
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:55,440
it was, in fact, a massacre are of course, all contradictory.

61
00:05:55,770 --> 00:06:01,350
But the upshot was that the Legion became particularly feared and hated, and led American irregulars

62
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:05,070
to start offering the British what they like to call Carlton's quarter.

63
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:12,659
That is no quarter at all. The Battle of wax off and push the last of the Continentals out of South

64
00:06:12,659 --> 00:06:17,730
Carolina, forcing the Continental Congress to scramble a response to stop the British before they could

65
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:23,370
spread further north. Who to put in charge of this response seemed like an easy choice.

66
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:26,610
Oh, the Conway cabal had failed to oust Washington.

67
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:32,880
The sentiment still persisted that the war would be one only of Horatio gates, the hero of Saratoga,

68
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,630
led the waysays there was no question that Washington had to stay outside of New York City.

69
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:43,250
Gates, his allies in Congress found little opposition to putting their man in charge of the Southern

70
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:47,390
department. Even as Washington himself recommended Nathaniel Greene.

71
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:54,350
Gates was given his orders in May 17. At And off he went, it would take just under three months for

72
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:57,380
everyone to realise what a terrible mistake they had just made.

73
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:04,700
Before Charleston fell in Congress had dispatched two regiments of Continentals from Maryland and Delaware

74
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:09,110
to go relieve the besieged city. But these forces had not made it in time.

75
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:15,530
So this group of about 1400 wind up forming the Corps of gates his new army, and he linked up with them

76
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:18,980
in Hillsboro, North Carolina at the end of July 1780.

77
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:25,909
what he found was not a pretty sight, these guys were worn out, badly supplied and poorly armed.

78
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:29,840
Even the camp itself was a mess of crude disorganised huts.

79
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:35,210
So it was clear, the first order of business would be resting these men and organising a proper supply

80
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:40,130
train because they were for the moment in no shape to be fighting, which is why the minute he showed

81
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:44,750
up, gates first forced the men to turn out for parade and then ordered them to march toward the city

82
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:50,180
of Camden, South Carolina, one of those strategic strong points the British control on the border between

83
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:55,220
the Carolinas. Nearly every officer present begged him not to do it.

84
00:07:55,640 --> 00:08:02,360
But gates believed Camden was held by just 700 men, it could be taken easily so off this bedraggled

85
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:08,390
army went and just to make sure that things went from bad to worse, gates ordered them all down a road

86
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:12,320
flank on both sides by swamp land, cutting off access to any supplies.

87
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:17,210
Not that there was much to be had anyway, given the loyalist leanings of the local population.

88
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:25,280
So it was a sick, tired and hungry mob who shuffled toward Camden in the brutal summer heat of 1780.

89
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:30,200
Oh, did I mention they also don't have any artillery or cavalry? Yeah, there's that too.

90
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:38,330
It was not all bad news, though. As gate marked, his army was reinforced by companies of North Carolina

91
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:43,520
and Virginia militia. They all neared Camden on August the seventh the nominal strength of the Americans

92
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:49,310
was up to about 4000. Though sickness and malnutrition left this number deceptively inflated.

93
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:55,460
Incredibly, though, Gates was totally ignorant about his own strength when he believed he commanded

94
00:08:55,460 --> 00:09:01,640
some 7000 men. With this number lodged in his head, he was supremely confident that he could take camp

95
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:06,740
and even if it was reinforced, which, oh, by the way, Cornwallis was personally rushing to do after

96
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:09,319
loyal supplies tipped him off to Gates's movements.

97
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:13,580
Cornwallis was soon in Camden with about 2000 able bodied men.

98
00:09:14,569 --> 00:09:19,550
As the Americans made their final approach a week later, Gates was alerted that an official headcount

99
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:24,230
put his numbers at something like half of what he fought, but already committed to the battle in his

100
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:28,400
heart. Gates just let this revelation pass without changing his plans.

101
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:36,590
At 10pm, on the night of August the 15th 17th, at both Cornwallis AND gates put their armies in motion,

102
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:41,450
Gates was still under the impression he was on his way to envelop a much smaller British force inside

103
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:46,370
the city, and had no idea that he was about to run smack into a British army roughly the same size as

104
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:52,160
his own. But at about 230 in the morning, that's exactly what happened was the advanced guard to both

105
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:59,750
armies bang right into each other. Both generals called an alarm halt when the sun rose gates and Cornwallis

106
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:06,170
Not only were they can't just 300 yards apart, but also that the numbers were far more even than either

107
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:11,270
had previously suspected. Because Cornwallis no less than gates thought the Americans would have a big

108
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:17,780
numerical advantage. I mean, why else would gates be rushing into battle? gates did have more troops,

109
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:22,850
but most of the militiamen from Virginia and North Carolina had never even sniffed a battle.

110
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:27,470
So to put it bluntly, the Battle of Camden was not a battle gates should have been fighting.

111
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:30,620
But now he was here, and there was nowhere else to go.

112
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:37,160
With this strategic blunder in place, gates then started making tactical blunders.

113
00:10:37,819 --> 00:10:43,160
He lined up the untested Virginia militia against what he thought was the loyalist militia, but which

114
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:45,710
turned out to be the best regular troops Cornwallis hat.

115
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:51,620
Then when gates spied those best regular troops, Cornwallis had futzing around and still forming up

116
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:55,550
he ordered the Virginia militia to advance except the movements that gates spied.

117
00:10:55,910 --> 00:11:00,589
Were not the British warming up at all, but the British preparing to advance, so they were more than

118
00:11:00,589 --> 00:11:03,200
ready to square off against the approaching Virginians.

119
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:09,180
A sharp Mali stopped the Virginia militia in its tracks, and the British fixed bayonets and chargedwith

120
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:12,240
no bayonets of their own, The Virginian simply turned in ran.

121
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:18,930
Most never even fired a shot. The Panic of the Virginians quickly spread to the North Carolina men who

122
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:24,810
had been nervously holding the line beside them, but who were now often running to the whole left flank

123
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:30,630
collapsed in a matter of minutes. On the right, the Delaware and Maryland regimens held their ground

124
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:35,700
and even managed to charge but they were now badly outnumbered and when Cornwallis ordered Tarleton

125
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:39,960
to take in the cavalry and clear out the Americans, it didn't take much convincing to force them all

126
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:47,610
into a chaotic retreat. Meanwhile, General gates had pulled back about a quarter of a mile to stand resolute

127
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:53,160
as the rallying point for his panicked and beaten men, proving once again the American ability to maintain

128
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:56,430
coherence and dignity even after a crushing defeat.

129
00:11:57,060 --> 00:12:04,230
Haha, just kidding. When the Virginia militia ran gates bolted by nightfall, he was 60 miles north.

130
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:08,910
A few days later, he was back in Hillsborough, another 120 miles further up the road.

131
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:15,300
He left behind 900 killed and wounded, another 1000 captured and a beleaguered remnant that didn't know

132
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:18,360
what they were supposed to do now and so most just went home.

133
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:22,800
Battle of Camden was in every way a crushing defeat.

134
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:28,920
It was pretty much the end of her ratio gates. He would survive the call for an inquiry of his conduct,

135
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:33,510
and later even wound up on Washington staff. But his reputation died on the battlefield.

136
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:37,620
Along with so many of his men, he was never again given a field command.

137
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:45,090
On the other side, Cornwallis bask in the glow of this decisive victory, victory that had the added

138
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:48,360
bonus of avenging British honour by crushing Horatio gates.

139
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:53,730
But that glow soon dimmed under the realisation that it seemed to change the political situation in

140
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:59,550
the Carolinas not a bit. The raids and skirmishes and guerrilla attacks between loyalists and patriots

141
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:04,440
continued as if nothing had happened. And the Continental Congress simply got to work organising another

142
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:10,230
army. The Battle of Camden was a great triumph for Cornwallis, but in the end, practically nothing came

143
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:17,880
of it. But that said, the things in South Carolina were looking good enough for the moment for Cornwallis

144
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,490
to start making plans to move up into North Carolina.

145
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:26,460
But this is where the relationship breakdown between Cornwallis and Henry Clinton starts getting in

146
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:31,710
the way. As I mentioned, the two were now reduced to exchanging passive aggressive letters.

147
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:37,080
Cornwallis wanted Clinton to launch a diversionary campaign to make sure North Carolina didn't receive

148
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:42,330
much in the way of continental reinforcements. Clinton was happy to do it, but only after Cornwallis

149
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:47,430
hit the road. But Cornwallis didn't want to hit the road until after he was assured the diversion had

150
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:53,069.
been launched. This petty little back and forth ended when Cornwallis decided to just move up to North

151
00:13:53,069. --> 00:13:57,300
Carolina. He was over the border in Charlotte by the end of September 17.

152
00:13:57,330 --> 00:14:03,750
At but would find that North Carolina was not as hospitable nor South Carolina as pacified, as he had

153
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:09,569
previously believed. As it turned out, the grand strategy to choke off the rebellion from the south

154
00:14:09,569 --> 00:14:15,000
was not the Sure thing. Everyone in the ministry had desperately convinced themselves that it would be.

155
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:22,260
But before we go on in the south, where Nathaniel Greene is about to take over for the Americans and

156
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:28,140
exacerbate Cornwallis is also we need to peel off and deal with the utterly shocking treason of American

157
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:33,480
war hero Benedict Arnold. unquestionably the most famous bit of treason in American history.

158
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:40,500
at his best, Arnold was an utterly fearless leader, a man who dreamed up bold strokes and then personally

159
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:47,010
led the way. But at his worst, Arnold was an easily disgruntle hothead, who could find a way to rub

160
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:53,250
practically everyone the wrong way. From day one, he had steward over the slow advance of his career,

161
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:56,700
always believing he was at least one or two ranks below his merit.

162
00:14:57,450 --> 00:15:02,370
He gets sympathy points for a problem. We being right about that, but get to those points taken away

163
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:08,040
by complaining about it relentlessly. So about the time he was appointed military governor of Philadelphia

164
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:14,280
in May 1778, Arnold had both a huge chip on his shoulder and a tonne of enemies, just waiting for him

165
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:19,260
to slip up. This combination was disastrous for his loyalty to the American cause.

166
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:26,579
The angle of attack Arnold numerous enemies took was the reputation he had earned over the years for

167
00:15:26,579 --> 00:15:29,579
making sure that every campaign was a profitable campaign.

168
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:35,490
You know what I mean? Starting with his early adventures in Canada, there were whispers that Arnold

169
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:41,700
was as much interested in lining his own pockets, as he was in defeating the British conduct as governor

170
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:44,579
Philadelphia only increased the volume of those whispers.

171
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:49,920
He lived in lavish style and got into the business of transporting warm material around for the Continental

172
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:55,589
Army, which wasn't illegal, but it did run him afoul of local merchants whose business he was cutting

173
00:15:55,589 --> 00:16:02,280
into. adding fuel to the fire was Arnold's Courtship of Peggy Shipton, the daughter of a wealthy Philadelphia

174
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:07,910
judgewith well known loyalist ties. Soon his political opponents were gathering evidence of Arlen's

175
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:15,140
misconduct and misappropriations. The Courtship of Young Miss Shipton, who is about to become young,

176
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:20,600
Mrs. Arnold also moved on into loyalist inclines social circles in Philadelphia.

177
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:24,560
And those social circles put him in contact with British intelligence officers.

178
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:30,230
intelligence officers, major john Andre, who had just recently been courting the same is shipped and

179
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:37,790
during the British occupation of Philadelphia seems that by at least July 1779, disgruntled and disenchanted,

180
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:41,240
Arnold was passing along information about American troop deployments.

181
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:47,060
While this secret correspondence was underway, Arnold enemies finally had enough to take to Congress

182
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:52,640
and demand that he be brought up on charges. When Arnold was informed of all this, he demanded a court

183
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:55,760
martial to clear his name and defend his besmirched honour.

184
00:16:56,270 --> 00:17:00,290
This while he was telling Henry Clinton that for the right price, he would switch sides.

185
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,020
Arnold's court martial was initially set to begin in June 1779.

186
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:11,450
But Clinton's advance up the Hudson his Stony Point threw it back six months, so it wasn't until January

187
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:18,109
17. At the trial began. The various charges levied against him went all the way back to his early days

188
00:17:18,109 --> 00:17:23,960
up in Canada, and the embittered Arnold was further embittered when his expense reports from that campaign

189
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:28,760
couldn't be verified because all the records had gone down with his ship during the Battle of valcour

190
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:32,090
Island, which, you know, I'm sorry, I don't have the receipts.

191
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:36,020
I was too busy stopping the British Army from invading and wiping you all out.

192
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:42,680
In the end, Arnold's record out shown his reputation and he was cleared of all but too small charges.

193
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:47,750
This was mostly of indication, but it left him on the hook to the Congress for 1000 unaccounted for

194
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:51,500
pounds. And that pretty much sealed the deal for Benedict Arnold.

195
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:57,530
Despite these unseemly charges, Washington tried to keep Arnold in the fold.

196
00:17:57,530 --> 00:18:03,620
I mean, after all, he was a great officer. And in June 1780, he offered Arnold command of Fort West

197
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:08,960
Point up on the Hudson River, which Arnold immediately turned around and used as leverage with Clinton.

198
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:14,900
He offered to turn over the fort for 20,000 pounds and indemnification for financial losses, he would

199
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:21,050
no doubt to stain as a result of his treason. Clinton thought this over stuck mostly on the issue of

200
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:24,680
indemnification, which was way too wide open a financial commitment.

201
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:29,840
By the end of August, though, Clinton agreed to the 20,000 but not the indemnification.

202
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:35,150
Arnold accepted and set to work deliberately weakening the defences of West Point.

203
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:40,910
This went on for a good month, which no one the wiser, though I'm sure there were a few puzzled looks

204
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:46,160
among soldiers about some of the stuff they were being told to do, or more importantly, told not to

205
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:54,470
do. On September the 21st 17, at Arnold finally had a face to face meeting with major Andre who snuck

206
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:59,150
behind enemy lines to pick up the plans for the Ford along with some other thoroughly incriminating

207
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:04,550
documents. But two days later, Andre was captured in civilian clothes trying to make his way back to

208
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:11,300
New York City. Coincidentally, the morning after Andre was captured, Arnold was set to have breakfast

209
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:14,420
with General Washington and review how things were going at West Point.

210
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:20,420
Arnold learned of Andres capture literally minutes before Washington was due to arrive.

211
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:25,880
When the commander in chief showed up he of course could not find Arnold anywhere because he was running

212
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:32,060
like a madman for New York City. Washington did however, find an inconsolable Peggy shipped and now

213
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:38,540
Peggy Arnold, who couldn't believe that her husband would commit treason like that she was shockedshocked,

214
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:41,240
Itell you to discover that there was gambling going on in this establishment.

215
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:47,120
The gentlemanly Washington consoled her in her grief, suspecting not even a bit that she was basically

216
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:54,320
the one who had arranged the whole thing. Though Washington raged privately, publicly, he took the sudden

217
00:19:54,320 --> 00:20:00,620
betrayal and stride and calmly offered to hand over Andre in exchange for Arnold Henry Clinton refused

218
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:05,780
though. It seems like an awfully cold decision given how much he apparently loved Andre and despised

219
00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:09,410
Arnold as traders are almost always despised by everyone.

220
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:13,910
Even the side they're helping so remember kids, no one likes a trader.

221
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:20,150
The charismatic and charming Andre Meanwhile, soon endeared himself to his captors and influential men

222
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:24,830
on both sides tried to get him spared or at least shot as was befitting an Officer and a Gentleman.

223
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:28,070
But Washington refused to yield to sentimentality.

224
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:31,700
And he had Andre hanged on October the second as a spy.

225
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:37,130
Arnold Meanwhile, was commissioned as a brigadier general in the British Army never saw much of the

226
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:40,670
20,000 he had been promised as the plot had obviously failed.

227
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:46,160
He will show up again next week in command of troops in Virginia where American officers will be under

228
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:50,660
orders from Washington to summarily hang him, the ever fell into their hands.

229
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:58,220
So with the most famous case of treason now wrapped up we can return to the southern theatre.

230
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,800
We're just a few days after major Andre was hanged.

231
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:05,780
A particularly brutal little battle was fought between 1000 patriot militiamen and 1000.

232
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:09,770
loyalists militiamen at Kings Mountain in back country, South Carolina.

233
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:16,190
The American militia companies working without an overall commander managed to surprise and then surround

234
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:21,680
a loyalist camp. After an hour of fighting in their commander dead the loyalist tried to give up but

235
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:26,150
either from confusion or from a desire to extend their enemy Carlton's quarter.

236
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:31,940
The Americans continued firing. Intel 300 loyalists lay dead and another 160 wounded.

237
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:36,440
Eventually, the killing stopped and the remaining 600 loyalists were taken prisoner.

238
00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:42,080
But a few days after the Battle of viciousness continued, as patriot militiamen started holding summary

239
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:47,030
court martials of captured loyalists, and nine men were hanged before one of the Patriot leaders stepped

240
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:53,570
in and put a stop doing. The immediate impact of Kings Mountain was to turn the tide in the Carolina

241
00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:59,090
back country, marking the rise of the Patriots and the decline of the loyalists and forcing Cornwallis

242
00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:05,060
to reconsider his plans. After receiving very little in the way of support from North Carolina loyalists,

243
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:10,820
and now sensing trouble in his rear, Cornwallis pulled out of Charlotte and headed back to South Carolina.

244
00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:18,380
Meanwhile, the Continental Congress suitably chastened by their decision to ignore Washington's advice

245
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:23,420
and put gates in charge of the South passed a resolution leaving it to the commander in chief to select

246
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:29,300
the next leader of the Southern department. Washington appointed Nathaniel green the same day he received

247
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:35,900
the order. Green, as you will recall, had started as an eager young officer who had promised to hold

248
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:38,780
Fort Washington and then promptly lost Fort Washington.

249
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:43,970
He then moved on to being a pretty competent subordinate commander during the campaigns in New Jersey

250
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:49,460
and Philadelphia. Near the end of the winter at Valley Forge, green was appointed Quartermaster general

251
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:55,310
with the Continental Army, a thankless and gruelling task that he performed well, in spite sulking a

252
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:58,580
bit that no one has ever heard of a Quartermaster general in history.

253
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:04,220
He was led out on parole to go take part in the siege of Newport, and then successfully resigned the

254
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:09,860
quartermaster post in 1780. As we just saw, Washington tried to get him appointed to the Southern Command,

255
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:15,500
but it took gates botching the job for green to get his chance to earn the spot in history he had been

256
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:23,570
craving. Green took with him Baron von stuben, who wound up in Virginia organising the supply lines

257
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:27,020
a job, I'm sure green relish not having to deal with himself.

258
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:32,120
He also had with him a guy whose name I tried to shield you from since we've already got way too many

259
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:36,410
names flying around. But now he's unavoidable. Daniel Morgan.

260
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:42,800
Morgan was the leader of that crack sharpshooter company that had done so much damage at Saratoga.

261
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:47,600
He technically had retired in 1779 after being passed over her promotion.

262
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:53,030
But when Congress offered him a brigadier general ship, he took it and headed for the Carolinas.

263
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:57,980
When green and Morgan arrived at the Hillsboro camp in late November 1780.

264
00:23:58,310 --> 00:24:04,850
They found a scene not unlike the scene that had greeted Horatio gates earlier in the year 1400 men

265
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:11,420
in bad shape with little to eat, rags to wear the usual lot for the common continental soldier.

266
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:17,240
Green then moved down to the American camp outside of Charlotte and found it not only smaller and more

267
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:22,880
pathetic, but also plagued by internal rivalries between the various leaders of the North Carolina militias.

268
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:28,550
In all, green commanded now about 2000 men, most not in great shape.

269
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:36,710
In an ultimately inspired but what looked according to every rule in the book as a lunatic decision,

270
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:43,240
Greene decided to divide his smaller and weaker army into two branches, hoping that by doing so he could

271
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:49,060
not only drum up recruits in multiple areas simultaneously, but also hoping that it would force Cornwallis

272
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:52,870
to divide up his own forces. And the more divided the British, the better.

273
00:24:54,070 --> 00:25:00,430
So in late December 17, at Daniel Morgan and about 600 men a mix of continental and Milan Sherman went

274
00:25:00,430 --> 00:25:06,790
west up the Qatada River. In January the second Cornwallis sent Colonel Tarleton and his Legion off

275
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:12,820
in pursuit. The two forces manoeuvred around each other, with Morgan picking up recruits and Tarleton

276
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:17,020
receiving reinforcements. until both were leading just over 1000 men.

277
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:22,720
Morgan eventually decided that Tarleton was good enough a tactician to trap him one of these days, so

278
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:26,920
he selected a site to make a stand at a spot called Hanna's cow pens.

279
00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:32,860
Morgan's choice was a terrible one by conventional standards, because flanks were wide open to cavalry

280
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:36,790
attacks, and he put a river in his back making retreat impossible.

281
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:43,030
But Morgan later said that this was the idea. The problem with the militiamen is that they run they

282
00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:49,000
don't have anywhere to run, maybe they'll fight. Then he added another dimension asking the militia and

283
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:53,230
only to fire to volleys and then fall back behind the sterner Continentals.

284
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:58,420
So I'm not asking you to stand up to the cream of the British Army here just fire to volleys and then

285
00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:01,390
you can get the hell out of there. You can do that much kancha.

286
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:09,790
And it turns out that they could. On the morning of January the 17th tarlton led his men up in a conventional

287
00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:13,630
line on a frontal assault of Morgan's position on a low hill at the cow pens.

288
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:18,640
The militiamen did their job firing to volleys into the British and then falling back.

289
00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:24,760
Tarleton took this understandably is the American to once again running for it and he ordered his men

290
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:28,870
to charge in, but all they found was the core of Continentals waiting for them.

291
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:34,780
gunfire gateway to a bayonet charge, and suddenly it was the British, not the Americans who were falling

292
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:40,270
back. Then the militiamen who had supposedly run off reappeared on their flanks and the British started

293
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:43,090
getting enveloped, and then they started surrendering.

294
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:51,940
After an hour of fighting, they lost 100 dead, another 200 wounded and over 800 captured, Carlton himself

295
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:57,220
managed to just barely get away and bring to Cornwallis the thoroughly unhappy news that most of their

296
00:26:57,220 --> 00:27:04,720
best troops had just been captured. Cornwallis immediately took off in pursuit of Morgan, but his intelligence

297
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:09,880
network was by now in total collapse, and he set off down the wrong road in the wrong direction.

298
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:15,520
Meanwhile, Nathaniel Greene got word of the Battle of cow pens, and rode off with a small escort to

299
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:20,050
link up with Morgan and guide him back to the rest of the army, which green had ordered to start pulling

300
00:27:20,050 --> 00:27:26,889
back to Virginia to regroup. What followed was the so called race to the Dan, the Dan river, marking

301
00:27:26,889 --> 00:27:32,590
the boundary between North Carolina and Virginia. Green linked up with Morgan on January the 31st.

302
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:38,860
Cornwallis shed all his baggage, and the two army spent the next week racing North often just miles

303
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:43,570
apart through terrible weather with every Ford at every river swollen my reign.

304
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:50,290
as they approach the dam, Cornwallis was once again tripped up by bad intelligence, thinking there was

305
00:27:50,290 --> 00:27:56,110
no good place to cross downstream, Cornwallis swung west to head off green and Morgan, but there was

306
00:27:56,110 --> 00:28:00,760
a spot to cross downstream where the rest of the Americans were waiting for their Conrad's to appear.

307
00:28:01,810 --> 00:28:06,700
Now at full strength, green wanted to make a stand right there, but he was talked out of it and the

308
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:11,770
Americans started crossing into Virginia. When Cornwallis finally appeared after being led around on

309
00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:17,290
a wild goose chase, he had no way himself to cross the river as all the boats had been pulled to the

310
00:28:17,290 --> 00:28:23,530
other side. Frustrated, Cornwall is pulled back to Hillsboro, where he tried and basically failed to

311
00:28:23,530 --> 00:28:26,560
raise some loyalist militia companies to augment his forces.

312
00:28:27,130 --> 00:28:31,389
By now, he was totally despairing of his ability to hold on to the Carolinas.

313
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:37,180
But about a week after the Americans crossed into Virginia, green received some bad intelligence of

314
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:43,090
his own, that the recruitment drive in North Carolina was working, and that if he didn't act fast, Cornwallis

315
00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:49,600
might command an unbeatable army. So on February 23, green LED his men back into North Carolina.

316
00:28:50,139 --> 00:28:54,280
The two armies manoeuvre around each other for another two weeks, and it was soon apparent that the

317
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:58,780
Americans actually now outnumber the British something like 40 502,000.

318
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:04,389
But even with this disparity, it was Cornwallis who decided to finally press for an attack on March

319
00:29:04,389 --> 00:29:09,460
15, the American camp at Guildford courthouse in northern North Carolina.

320
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:16,960
Green was ready for the attack and have the superior numbers but the British were as always more disciplined

321
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:21,880
than the American militia companies. And despite being out number two to one, the British just kept

322
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:28,480
coming and coming until the Americans retreated most in good order, the rest not so much.

323
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:34,810
For Cornwallis, the battle at Guilford Courthouse was the quintessential Pyrrhic victory.

324
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:39,920
He had won the battle and held the field. But he had lost something like a quarter of his men in the

325
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:45,500
process. He couldn't pursue green and he couldn't stop the spread of news that the British were spread

326
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:50,510
then and losing control of the Carolinas. loyalists morale was devastated.

327
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:55,610
The Patriots were exuberant. The momentum had shifted decisively.

328
00:29:57,860 --> 00:30:03,620
Next week, we will See what both Cornwallis and green thought of their respective chances in the Carolinas

329
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:09,950
as Cornwallis pulled out and green dove in? Not the Cornwall's his troubles were over when he ditched

330
00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:16,130
the Carolina swamp. Its next base of operations would be on the Chesapeake Bay, at a place called Yorktown,

331
00:30:16,130 --> 00:30:16,640
Virginia.
