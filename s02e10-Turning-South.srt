00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:14,440
Hello, and welcome to revolutions Episode 26. Turning south.

2
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:24,880
Okay, so last time we ended with the newly minted British commander in chief Henry Clinton, fending

3
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:29,500
off the American attack at Monmouth courthouse and escaping with his army up to New York City.

4
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:35,800
Just barely unable to rent this escape. George Washington then led his own forces north, eventually

5
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:41,110
making a headquarters on the Hudson River. The exile of the Continental Congress, meanwhile, finally

6
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:46,390
ended and the delegates returned to Philadelphia, which was now under the military governorship of Benedict

7
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:51,550
Arnold, who was given the command in part because the injuries he sustained at Saratoga concluded a

8
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:57,880
field command. Now one crucial factor in Washington's decision to attack Clinton that I did not talk

9
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:01,120
about last week was the imminent arrival of the French fleet.

10
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:06,640
It was due to arrive literally any day now. And Washington hoped that if he could tie the British up

11
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:12,190
long enough that the French might appear and block any possible escape by sea for the British, and it

12
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:18,640
almost worked. After breaking out of Monmouth courthouse, Clinton did indeed run North East for Sandy

13
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:24,070
Hook, a spit that juts North out of New Jersey. From there, he put his men on boats to complete the

14
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:30,370
journey to New York City. The French fleet finally arrived as this varying operation was underway, but

15
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:35,380
they were unable to cross the sandbar that makes entering New York harbour somewhat treacherous, and

16
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:41,230
Clinton was able to make good his escape and holed up in New York City, with all but impossible to attack.

17
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:49,840
But though New York could not be gotten the fact that Washington now had an allied Navy greatly expanded

18
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:55,450
his strategic options. So if the big fish could not be fried, then best turn to the littler fish.

19
00:01:56,020 --> 00:02:01,810
And so Washington and the Admiral of the French fleet, the comp distain, coordinated on a plan to go

20
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:07,090
up and retake Newport, Rhode Island, which was occupied by the British with a garrison of about 3000

21
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:14,110
men. So at the end of July 1778, the French sailed north, or the Americans started funnelling troops

22
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:19,390
both local militia and a strong contingent of Continentals underneath Daniel green in the Marquis de

23
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:24,190
Lafayette into Rhode Island, and soon they would total about 10,000 men.

24
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:30,400
spies quickly revealed to Henry Clinton what the Americans were up to, and he scrambled to provide Newport

25
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:36,490
relief, first 20 ships under Admiral Howe, and then as soon as the weather permitted a convoy of about

26
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:43,540
4000 regular troops. Now, unfortunately for the Americans, and all the coming attack on Newport did

27
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:48,370
was prove that the alliance between the French and Americans was great in theory, but would take some

28
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:54,910
time to really work in practice. The man running the show up in Newport, was Brigadier General john

29
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:58,810
Sullivan. Solomon was the son of Irish immigrants to America.

30
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:04,900
So as you can imagine, for him, this war was as much about an intense loading of the British as any

31
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:11,230
noble fight for freedom and liberty. But his lower class Irish upbringing, did not leave him with much

32
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:16,750
love for French aristocrats either. And for their part, those French aristocrats weren't much for low

33
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:22,270
born Irish revolutionaries. right from the get go, and coordinating the attack on Newport was rough

34
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:28,300
going, as Solomon attempted to simply issue orders to distain, which distain was not super interested

35
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:34,450
in obeying. But despite the friction, the plans for a joint operation finally came together, and the

36
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:43,210
attack was set to launch August the 10th 1778.A new port is located on the southwest tip of a skinny

37
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:48,700
island that ran north south off the mainland. The plan was for the Americans to move down and trap the

38
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:53,740
British inside the city. While the French landed 4000 men of their own on the western shore, and then

39
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:59,950
arrayed their ships in a tight blockade. The combined land and sea attack was sure to break the British

40
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:06,490
garrison in no time. But on August the ninth, the day before, this was all supposed to happen, Sullivan

41
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:11,380
spied an opportunity to get the jump on the British and he moved down early, which only confirmed the

42
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:15,610
French opinion that these Americans weren't disciplined enough to really count on I mean, right off

43
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:21,940
the bat, they're jumping the gun. Then the 20 British ships under Admiral how appeared on the horizon

44
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:27,010
to sane decided that there was no sense getting trapped with only the American rebel to support him.

45
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:30,850
So instead of landing the French troops he pulled out of the harbour completely.

46
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:36,700
For two days the French and British fleets manoeuvred around each other until an intense Gale ravaged

47
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:41,530
them both the British wound up so bad off that Howe had to simply pull out of the area completely.

48
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:44,800
The French Meanwhile, were scattered all over the place.

49
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:51,310
But despite the sudden French withdrawn, General Sullivan pressed on, he was still running 10,000 men

50
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:54,730
against just 3000 inside the city and those are pretty good numbers.

51
00:04:55,270 --> 00:05:01,000
By August the 15th. He was digging fortifications to carry on with the siege Over the next couple of

52
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,180
days, the battered French ships started to return back to port.

53
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:07,360
But the stain had seemed quite not Thank you very much.

54
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:11,470
When as much of the fleet as possible had regrouped, he announced that he was sailing his fleet up to

55
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:16,570
Boston for repairs, taking with him and he real chance of capturing Newport.

56
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:23,050
When the French sailed away, the American militia forces were like, okay, we're done here, and they

57
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:29,050
started heading home. So I will then tried to carry on through these obviously, Operation killing setbacks,

58
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:32,800
Lafayette raced up to Boston to try to convince the state to change his mind.

59
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:38,500
But by the end of the month, Sullivan finally admitted that if he didn't retreat, his force of now just

60
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:44,590
5000 men would soon be trapped. So he started to pull off the island, which the British garrison in

61
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:49,870
Newport took as the perfect opportunity to strike and the retreating Americans were forced to turn and

62
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:53,710
fight a day's worth of battle exhausted both sides.

63
00:05:54,039. --> 00:06:01,030
But in the end, Solomon was able to complete his withdraw just in time to the very next day those additional

64
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:06,130
4000 regular sent by Clinton delayed by the same bad weather that had crippled the British and French

65
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:11,919
Navy's finally arrived. So the Battle of Rhode Island went down merely as an awkward first date for

66
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:15,940
the French and Americans, rather than a relationship ending catastrophe.

67
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:23,770
With Newport now strengthened in New York City all but unapproachable, both George Washington and Henry

68
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:28,840
Clinton settled into an unsatisfying stalemate. Neither were happy about it.

69
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:33,159
But it appears that of the two Clinton was actually even less happy than Washington.

70
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:39,310
He was not enthusiastic about the ministry's plan to turn the war south, especially after he received

71
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:44,650
orders to send 3500 men down to Georgia, and another 5000 down to the West Indies.

72
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:50,409
That would leave him with just enough troops to hold what he had and maybe right around a little bit,

73
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:55,000
but not much more, which is just about all the ministry wanted him to do anyway.

74
00:06:56,050 --> 00:07:01,750
After reluctantly dispatching these forces in November in December 1778, the miserable Clinton sent

75
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:05,140
a letter of resignation back to London in early 1779.

76
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:12,010
But despite his pleading, it was rejected. King George declared Clinton the only man left who could

77
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:18,340
pull off a win in North America, Clinton, no doubt sunk even further into his chair after receiving this

78
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:28,630
glowing vote of confidence. So unfortunately for everyone, US included 1779 turned out to be as fragmented

79
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:34,750
as it was inconclusive. There were engagements all over the place, but none were really decisive nor

80
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:40,419
super important to the outcome of the war. For simplicity's sake, we're going to stick with Clinton

81
00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:43,630
and Washington for now as they skirmish around each other in New York.

82
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:48,580
Then we will double back and follow distain and his fleet as they make a run through the Caribbean.

83
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:53,890
And then we'll double back again for the British capture of Savannah, Georgia, the failed attempt by

84
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:59,920
the French and Americans to retake Savannah, Georgia, before finally depositing ourselves in 1780, with

85
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:05,530
Henry Clinton's invasion of South Carolina, and the capture of Charleston, ready to dry and follow a

86
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:07,690
bunch of random roads that wind up leading nowhere.

87
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:15,790
Awesome, let's do it. After his resignation was rejected, Henry Clinton emerged from winter and did

88
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:21,670
his best to follow orders, which included using the Navy to raid coastal communities to disrupt rebel

89
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:26,320
trade, a strategy that the ministry now loved when he personally loathed.

90
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
raids of Connecticut and the Chesapeake Bay were successful.

91
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:36,210
Stores public buildings and supply houses were easily destroyed, but not too much long term strategic

92
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:42,780
effect. The only real engagement of the year which similarly did not have much long term strategic effect

93
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:48,540
was the Battle of Stoney point, fought over a fortified spirit that jetted out into the Hudson River

94
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:53,070
about 30 miles north of New York City, and that commanded an important river crossing.

95
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:58,650
In late May, Clinton personally led his reduced army up the Hudson.

96
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:04,800
He easily took Stony Point hoping that this would merely be the first move any longer range campaign

97
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:09,870
to disrupt the American supply lines enough to force them to come down from their fortified positions

98
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:13,920
and fight a real bout. He had been promised reinforcements from Britain.

99
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:19,200
But the ships crossing the Atlantic were soon long overdue, and Clinton was forced to withdraw back

100
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:24,000
to New York City, leaving a garrison of about 750 in control of Stoney point.

101
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:31,530
After Clinton fell back down the Hudson, Washington ordered general Anthony Wayne, who is about to become

102
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:38,460
known to history as mad Anthony Wayne for his conduct in the battle to take 1500 men and go retake Stoney

103
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:45,210
point. working under guidelines laid out by Washington, Wayne led what looked an awful lot like a suicide

104
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:50,280
mission when he stormed the British position from three directions in the middle of the night using

105
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:56,700
only band nets. Amazingly, it took Wayne's men just 30 minutes to capture the British position while

106
00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:03,090
suffering almost no casualties. It was a sad mall but morale boosting victory for the Americans who hadn't

107
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:09,210
really had much to cheer about since Saratoga as per Washington's instructions, when then destroyed

108
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:12,810
the fortifications, hauled off the cannons and abandoned the site.

109
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:16,410
Clinton eventually sent a man up to retake it later in the summer.

110
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:21,420
By then the British commander in chief was deep into planning the invasion of South Carolina, and the

111
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:26,130
whole back and forth over Stony Point, wound up being a pointless dead end for everyone.

112
00:10:28,319 --> 00:10:33,810
Further to the west out on the New York frontier in general john Sullivan, he of the siege of Newport

113
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:39,720
was dispatched on a not particularly glorious campaign to exact revenge on loyalists in upstate New

114
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:47,730
York, and particularly their Iroquois allies. The Patriot presses had been inflamed in 1778 by Indian

115
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:52,650
attacks on settlers in the Wyoming Valley out on the New York frontier, and then somewhat closer in

116
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:59,550
at cherry Valley A few months later. In both cases, non combatants were specifically targeted and killed.

117
00:11:00,569 --> 00:11:07,290
So over the summer, 1779, Sullivan ran around with about 4000 men on a deliberate scorched earth campaign

118
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:13,680
that saw them burn or destroy some 40 Indian villages, killing who they could and driving off the rest.

119
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:20,340
It wasn't pretty, but it did help the American solidify control the North, which they would not relinquish

120
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:28,530
for the rest of the war. So that 1779 as far as Clinton and Washington are concerned, all pretty much

121
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:36,660
much ado about nothing. While this nothing much was playing out in New York, a similar bout of nothing

122
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:42,300
much was playing out down south. And by down south, I don't mean Georgia, which we'll get to in a minute.

123
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:49,170
I mean, the West Indies. Now, I don't want to get too much into it because it carries us a bit far afield.

124
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:53,819
But we need to at least touch on events in the West Indies so we can understand where the French have

125
00:11:53,819 --> 00:11:59,970
gotten off to, and why Clinton has to peel off men he really doesn't have to spare from a war he was

126
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:07,470
having a really hard time winning. When we last left, the comp disdain and his fleet.

127
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:12,690
They had sailed away for Boston. after refusing Lafayette police to come back to Newport.

128
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:17,730
distain repaired his battered fleet and then announced that he had decided to go down and attack British

129
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:24,300
positions in the Caribbean. His broad mandate gave him all the authority he needed to turn a deaf ear

130
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:29,490
to American please to stay, pole anchor and just sail away in November 1778.

131
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:36,180
Coincidentally enough, the French sailed on the same day as the 5000 men, the ministry ordered Clinton

132
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:43,410
to send down to the West Indies, put out to sea. When these two fleets arrived in the Caribbean, they

133
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:48,360
found their Conrad's already going at it, with each side having seized an island from the other.

134
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:54,810
With everyone now reinforced. A couple of indecisive naval battles were fought in December 1778.

135
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:59,550
But after that, both the French and British decided to just sort of keep an eye on each other for the

136
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:07,710
next six months. In June 1779, though, the British concentrated forces to protect a crucial convoy and

137
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:11,280
distain struck at the under defended British colonies of St.

138
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:17,490
Vincent and Granada. The British Fleet Commander, Admiral john Byron, who is the grandfather of Lord

139
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:23,880
Byron, by the way, rushed out to confront the French, but he rushed into quickly believing he had superior

140
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:30,330
numbers, which boy, he really did not.Though he didn't lose any ships, and Byron's fleet was beat to

141
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:37,710
a pulp and basically knocked out of commission. And a mysterious bit of I don't even know what distain

142
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:42,450
decided to follow up his decimation of the British fleet by doing nothing.

143
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:48,120
He quietly returned to French ports and repaired his fleet and took no further action.

144
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:54,030
When Byron sailed back to Britain in August, the stain decided to finally succumb to the endless pleading

145
00:13:54,030 --> 00:14:01,500
by the Americans to come back up and for God's sakes help us disdains failure to capitalise on the sizeable

146
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:08,130
naval advantage he now enjoyed. Method 1779 was nothing but a huge missed opportunity for the French,

147
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:13,050
but at least the stain can make up for his lacklustre performance in the West Indies by helping the

148
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:22,980
Americans retake Savannah. Right. So rewinding the clock again, shortly after Henry Clinton sent off

149
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:26,850
the 5000 men he didn't want to send to the West Indies down to the West Indies.

150
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:31,710
He sent the 3500 men he didn't want to send down to Georgia down to Georgia.

151
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:38,460
This mixed force of British regulars and hessians landed just south of Savannah two days before Christmas

152
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:45,780
1778 the only real city to speak of in Georgia. The British expedition arrived at the outskirts of town

153
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:53,130
a week later and found it to be easy pickings. There were few fortifications to speak of and the 850

154
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:56,880
Americans guarding the city were totally outnumbered and outgunned.

155
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:04,200
Then they got badly flung When a slave led a British column through the swamps west of town, in the

156
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:10,170
brief, practically no more than a skirmish that followed, the Americans bolted in panic, and the British

157
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:16,200
took the city after losing just three men. Then they marched up and took a gusta The only other thing

158
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:21,420
that could possibly call a city in Georgia, and they spent the summer of 1779, extending their control

159
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:27,510
across the whole rest of the state, coordinating with local loyalists of whom there were many was remembered

160
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:31,920
this was the one colony that had not sent a delegation to the first Continental Congress.

161
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:39,870
After the capture of Savannah, the American patriots in the south brace for more, but luckily for them

162
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:45,750
more was not yet on the way as Clinton was busy skirmishing around Stoney point and had not yet headed

163
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:52,290
south. So the American forces tried to consolidate and maybe put together a plan to march down and reassert

164
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:57,810
control over Georgia. The American general now in charge of the Southern department was a man named

165
00:15:57,810 --> 00:16:02,819
Benjamin Lincoln, who had been sent out to recuperate after being wounded at Saratoga.

166
00:16:03,569 --> 00:16:08,730
It was quickly apparent to him that any plan to retake Savannah was going to require an assist from

167
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:14,880
the French Navy, who were unfortunately, currently running around doing not much of anything in the West

168
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:22,770
Indies. So almost all of 1779 passed before any action could be taken with Lincoln headquartered in

169
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:29,010
Charleston. But then, kind of out of the blue, a few friendships arrived bearing the incredible news

170
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:33,930
that distain was on his way to Savannah with 25 gunships and 4000 soldiers.

171
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:37,860
Lincoln dropped what he was doing in lead 2000 men south.

172
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:43,560
Hopefully, this second joint American French operation would go better than Newport.

173
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:51,600
The French landed south of Savannah in mid September 1779, and Lincoln showed up shortly thereafter.

174
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:58,530
Initially, distain who personally led the French ground forces refused to directly attack the city.

175
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:02,670
Instead, he set up artillery to bomb the British into submission.

176
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:07,650
The Americans and French wound up shelling the city for almost a week straight.

177
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:12,900
Before distain decided that this wasn't going fast enough, and finally agreed to a frontal assault.

178
00:17:13,619 --> 00:17:18,389
Georgia was not treating his men well, and he frankly wanted to get the hell out of there as soon as

179
00:17:18,389 --> 00:17:25,139
possible. So on October the ninth 1779, the French and Americans attacked, and it quickly turned into

180
00:17:25,139 --> 00:17:32,130
a bloody fiasco. The main attack was supposed to be surprise, launch in darkness and covered by diversionary

181
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:38,580
attacks to confuse the British garrison. But the main allied column got lost in some heavy fog as they

182
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:44,160
pick their way through a swamp. So the attack didn't start until after sunup, so see you later element

183
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:49,320
of surprise. Then it turned out that the spot that the stain had selected to hit because it was the

184
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:54,270
weakest part of the defences turned out to be one of the strongest parts of the defences.

185
00:17:55,139 --> 00:18:00,540
So the assault was quickly stopped dead in its tracks, and then turned into a bloodbath.

186
00:18:01,139 --> 00:18:06,210
The stain was himself wounded twice, and the battered American and French were forced to retreat after

187
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:12,780
taking heavy losses. Totally whipped. Lincoln and distain officially agreed to call the siege just over

188
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:17,700
a week later, Savannah would remain in British hands until the end of the war.

189
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,920
There's one last little interesting note about the siege of Savannah I want to mention, because it will

190
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:30,500
be of interest to us not in our next revolution, the French Revolution, but in the one after that, the

191
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:37,310
Haitian Revolution. Because when distain came north, he brought with him about 500 Haitian fighters,

192
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:43,070
many of whom would help form the officer corps of the revolutionary armies who will battle it out after

193
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:50,360
the slave revolt of 1791. So let's watch out for those guys and hack before we move on.

194
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:55,400
I may as well mentioned that distain will meet his end in our next revolution, the French Revolution,

195
00:18:55,730 --> 00:19:01,100
because he was closely connected to the royal family and standing by Marie Antoinette right to the bitter

196
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:05,180
end, and he will be marched to the guillotine in 1794.

197
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:15,680
Okay, so that brings us to the end of 1779 that fractured and inconclusive year of fractured in conclusiveness.

198
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:24,140
And it brings us Finally, after all the talk to Henry Clinton's invasion of South Carolina, leaving

199
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:29,540
behind an adequate garrison in New York City under the command of a Hessian general Clinton wind up leading

200
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:35,810
about 10,000 men south where they would link up with loyalist militias, and already on the scene regulars

201
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:39,980
form an army of about 14,000 men to go take Charleston.

202
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:46,220
Once that was done, reasserting British control of the Carolinas would be an easy warm up for the tougher

203
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:48,920
challenges that would face them ahead in Virginia.

204
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:56,660
Clinton's army spent a rotten four weeks at sea being battered by storms before they finally put in

205
00:19:56,660 --> 00:20:00,200
near the mouth of the Savannah River where they picked up some additional forces.

206
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:05,840
The resting for a bit the British put back out to sea, finally arriving just south of Charleston in

207
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:14,120
February 1780. Now though, the coming Siege of Charleston turned out to be a nice win for Clinton, getting

208
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:21,530
there was not in fact, half the fun is first headache came in the form of an 86 year old at Bromley

209
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:24,500
Marriott. Arbuthnot, think I'm getting that name right.

210
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:32,120
He says it turns out Clinton and arbuthnott were actually equal in rank, British incoherent once again,

211
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:38,330
rearing its ugly head. So when they started disagreeing over strategy, and tactics are, let's say something

212
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:43,490
as simple as where to land the army. There wasn't a final decision maker to say we're going to land

213
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:50,690
here. Then during the siege itself, arbuthnott tended to alternate between the extremes of lethargy and

214
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:55,910
recklessness, with the flips seemingly designed to frustrate Clinton as much as possible.

215
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:03,560
Clinton second headache came in the form of his old comrade and now second in command, Lord Cornwallis,

216
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:07,160
who was now officially sick of being anyone's second in command.

217
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:12,770
He thought he had done enough to merit an independent army and wasn't happy about being stuck under

218
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:16,160
clinton. The two would begin feuding almost at once.

219
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:21,740
And pretty soon we'd be talking only through letters and vague passive aggressive tones that served

220
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:29,389
the British or effort not even a little bit. After finally landing his forces where he wanted to land

221
00:21:29,389 --> 00:21:34,550
them, Clinton's set out through the South Carolina swamp to try to get around behind Charleston.

222
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:39,080
And if slogging through the South Carolina swamp doesn't count as a third major headache.

223
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:46,670
I don't know what does. Now all of these headaches are somewhat relieved by the fact that the American

224
00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:51,260
fortifications at Charleston we're not in fact going to prove particularly formidable.

225
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:57,320
Charleston is located at the bottom of a peninsula surrounded on three sides by water.

226
00:21:57,830 --> 00:22:02,960
Benjamin Lincoln long since returned from Savannah, just assumed outright that any attack was going

227
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:09,200
to come from the sea. So the land facing fortifications were utterly neglected, consisting of a few redoubts

228
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:15,380
that were not even connected to each other. On the sea side where Lincoln expected the attack, he had

229
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:18,620
two forts that were just now being worked back into shape.

230
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:25,670
All Lincoln is roughly 3000 men and the citizens of Charleston really had going for them was the fact

231
00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:30,590
that a sandbar that ran just under the surface of the water, would make it really hard for arbuthnott

232
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:37,490
to bring his heavy ships into the harbour. By the end of March, and Clinton was finally able to swing

233
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:42,860
his way around, then come at the unsuspecting Americans from above, and on April the first, he and his

234
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:49,400
army were camped just 1000 yards from Charleston, Lincoln and the American garrison scramble to prevent

235
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:54,560
an instantaneous collapse of the line. And though the fortifications would ultimately prove inadequate,

236
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:58,520
for the moment, they did give Clinton pause about a full scale assault.

237
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,750
With Charleston now surrounded though time and resources were on the British side.

238
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:09,690
So Clinton commenced with a traditional European approach to siege craft, which involves digging out

239
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:14,490
an entrenchment, running parallel to the enemy fortifications, and then when that one was complete,

240
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:20,010
digging forward and starting another parallel line, slowly cutting off the ground between procedure and

241
00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:26,340
besieged. All through April, the British steadily advanced through random and sporadic American shelling.

242
00:23:28,290 --> 00:23:33,570
By the end of April, Clinton had completed his third parallel, and was trying to get Admiral Arbuthnot,

243
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:38,130
who had been putting ships across the sandbar to sail up the Copper River to help close the noose once

244
00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:43,890
and for all. But Arbuthnot, of course, stalled and made excuses and never did go up the river.

245
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:49,830
But even with this strategic bickering getting in the way, inside the city, Benjamin Lincoln could see

246
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:55,050
that the situation was hopeless, and against the begging and pleading of the citizens of Charleston.

247
00:23:55,260 --> 00:24:00,990
He attempted to surrender on April the 21st, hoping to get Clinton to let him March out with his men

248
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:04,830
in exchange for the city. But Clinton turned him down flat.

249
00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:10,950
The creeping British kept creeping until the second week of May, when a sharp artillery battle broke

250
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:16,950
out, wound up setting fire to the wood homes inside the city, forcing the residents to admit that it

251
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:22,260
was time to give up good terms, bad terms, whatever, we just need to give up.

252
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:30,150
So on May the 12th 17 at the American surrendered Charleston to the British officers and militiamen

253
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:32,640
were paroled on the promise that they would not rejoin the fight.

254
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:36,450
While the regular continental soldiers were taken as prisoners of war.

255
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:44,280
The Siege of Charleston had taken its toll on the already disenchanted Henry Clinton.

256
00:24:44,910 --> 00:24:50,250
His lot in life had come down to feuding with a curmudgeon of an admiral and bickering with an ambitious

257
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:56,160
and self possessed second in command. On June the first, Clinton issued what he thought would be the

258
00:24:56,160 --> 00:25:01,980
foundation of the British recovery of South Carolina all rebels who lay down their arms would be given

259
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:08,100
clemency. But the announcement had zero impact on the Patriot partisans who weren't about to just give

260
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:13,620
up. while simultaneously annoying the loyalist partisans who were frankly offended, the British would

261
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:17,190
even consider offering clemency to these damned rebel dogs.

262
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:24,120
frustrated and annoyed, Clinton elected to give Cornwallis the independent command he had been angling

263
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:31,139
for. A week after issuing his proclamation, Clinton took 4000 men and returned to New York City where

264
00:25:31,139 --> 00:25:37,740
he could stew in peace. Cornwallis was left with the rest of the army and orders to subdue South Carolina,

265
00:25:38,010 --> 00:25:41,220
then make his way through North Carolina into Virginia.

266
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:49,590
Next week, we will stay in the south with Cornwallis as he finally gets to enjoy the independent command

267
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:56,730
he had sought for so long. But Cornwallis would soon learn what engage and how and we're going and Clinton

268
00:25:56,730 --> 00:26:02,460
had all learned before him. The Americans just did not understand how wars were supposed to be won.

269
00:26:02,910 --> 00:26:07,560
And when you are beaten, and beaten and beaten again, you're supposed to give up.

270
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:13,740
Cornwallis will wind up just as bitter and frustrated as every other British General Who would ever

271
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:21,870
set foot on American soil. We're gonna leave off today though, with a short programming note that next

272
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:27,210
week, and then again in May, I'll be leading with an ad for our good friends at Harry's razors.

273
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:31,020
If you listen to other podcasts, you probably know about them already.

274
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:34,500
But now you'll get to know about them from me too.
