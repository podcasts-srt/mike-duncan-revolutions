00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:14,470
Hello, and welcome to revolutions Episode 25 Valley Forge.

2
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:23,410
Okay, so I did in fact survive my week with the boy so we are back.

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,280
When we left off last time, the Americans had just burger joined the British up at Saratoga seriously

4
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:32,880
to Burgoyne, someone briefly entered the American vocabulary.

5
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:38,519
The British surrender had profound consequences for the course of the war, it forced the British to

6
00:00:38,519 --> 00:00:43,440
rethink what they were doing. It led the Americans to briefly consider replacing General Washington with

7
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:48,989
ratio gates as commander in chief. But of course, the most profound consequence was that it caused the

8
00:00:48,989 --> 00:00:54,360
French to enter the war. So the first thing we need to do today is hop over to Paris.

9
00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:00,990
As I mentioned, a few episodes back, the French had been covertly assisting the Americans since about

10
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:08,160
the spring of 1776. As you can imagine, young King Louie The 16th was not super keen about funnelling

11
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:14,190
money to a bunch of Republican radicals. But his foreign minister, the hump day day version, oh, God

12
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:19,259
help us when we get to the French Revolution, persisted, and finally was able to carry the king along

13
00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:23,670
by pointing out that without French assistance, it was likely that Britain and her colonies would eventually

14
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:29,700
reconcile and that would not be good for France. So the king authorised money to be funnelled to the

15
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:34,980
Americans through a dummy Corporation set up in Paris and run by Connecticut merchant and emissary from

16
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:41,040
the Second Continental Congress, Silas Dean. Now on the whole, Silas Dean did a pretty good job for

17
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:47,310
his country. And the money and supplies did start flowing, but he also had a tendency to mix the public

18
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:50,610
account with his private accounts. If you catch my drift.

19
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:56,610
Dean would eventually come under heavy fire for his sloppy bookkeeping, though he would find a credible

20
00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:01,800
defender in Benjamin Franklin, who was practical enough of a man not to quibble over a little patriotic

21
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:04,650
graft. That's what it took to keep the wheels greased.

22
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:12,000
While Dean was funnelling most of the covert French money to the American war effort, the Second Continental

23
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,150
Congress was busy trying to secure a formal Alliance.

24
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:20,250
Now, as I mentioned, when discussing the Declaration of Independence, there was a serious debate over

25
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:26,910
whether independence must precede the Alliance or the Alliance independence with the independence firsters

26
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:34,470
winning the day. But with independence now declared it was time to vigorously pursue that European Alliance,

27
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:40,650
which was frankly fraught with danger. The Americans were bargaining from a very weak position, and

28
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:45,450
it was likely that the French, for example, would demand trade monopolies with American ports as the

29
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:51,120
necessary incentive to joining the war. But the last thing the Congress wanted, was to just swap out

30
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:56,970
the British for the French. So sticking point number one was the American insistence that they be allowed

31
00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:01,140
free trade with all of Europe, not just those countries that helped them.

32
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:04,350
This was of course, not what the French wanted to hear.

33
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:10,170
With the economic incentives going nowhere, and the Americans were able to make headway with a more

34
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:16,590
straight up real politic incentive. If we win, it'll be really bad for your mortal enemy, the British

35
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:22,710
Empire. This argument was already being channelled by Virgin and more or less became the foundation

36
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:27,630
upon which the Alliance was ultimately built. The enemy of my enemy is my friend.

37
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:34,170
But in 1776, continued to unfold, the French looked less and less likely to jump in.

38
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:39,180
I mean, this is when Washington is getting chased out of New York, and hopes for American success, AB

39
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:46,350
mightily. So in late 1776, the Congress dispatched the most influential and respected man, they had

40
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:51,240
Benjamin Franklin to go work his magic and work it he did.

41
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:57,510
Benjamin Franklin was a prominent merchant Bay scientists now living a life of gentlemanly leisure in

42
00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:03,210
fine Philadelphia style. But when he stepped off the boat in France, he was wearing his beaver pelt

43
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:10,020
hat, his glasses and low key country clothes. And from that moment on, he played the part of the frontier

44
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:16,110
New World rustic to perfection. Wherever he went, he utterly charmed French society with his intelligence,

45
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:22,230
his wit, and his quaint American style. It was all a show, of course, but it was one the French seem

46
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:27,600
to delight in partaking in Franklin and the French pretty much fell in love with each other, and Franklin

47
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:33,870
would spend the next decade among them. But all the charm in the world couldn't solve the insurmountable

48
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:38,850
hurdle to French involvement, the not unreasonable belief that the Americans simply couldn't win the

49
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:44,700
war. And what I mean by that is that the French had no interest in fighting the Americans war for them.

50
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:48,840
And until the Americans proved that they could hold their own and just needed some help to get over

51
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:52,410
the top. The French refused to go beyond covert payments.

52
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:58,530
The other big French concern though, was that the Americans were planning to simply use them as leverage

53
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:03,840
in their negotiations. With the British Ministry, so French involvement had to be about breaking the

54
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,500
British Empire apart, not helping to knit it back together.

55
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:11,730
The Declaration of Independence went a long way towards modifying that fear.

56
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:16,320
But it was almost impossible to tell from Paris whether that declaration represented the will of the

57
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,680
people, or the will of a tiny click of super radicals.

58
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:27,000
So this is where Franco American relations stood when news of Saratoga arrived in December 1777.

59
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:33,420
Word of Reagan's defeat, frankly stunned the French government, and along with reports of the failed

60
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:39,150
but professionally ambitious effort by Washington and Germantown lead the French to quickly start talking

61
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:44,940
formal Alliance. For one, the Americans who just clearly proved that they were fighting a real war with

62
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:51,150
real armies and could really win for another for going surrender open the very real possibility that

63
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:55,050
the war weary British might bag it and come to terms with the Americans.

64
00:05:55,620 --> 00:06:00,960
The French didn't act now this golden opportunity to divide the British Empire might pass them by.

65
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:06,630
And indeed, at that very moment, the British Ministry was in fact putting together a peace envoy that

66
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:14,460
would sail for America in the spring. So in February 1778, various treaties commercial political military,

67
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:18,480
started getting signed by the French government and the American representatives.

68
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:25,200
These made their way to the Congress in May 1778, just ahead of the British envoys who yes offered peace

69
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:28,890
terms, but those fell short of recognising independence.

70
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:32,550
Congress spurned the British overtures and took the deal with France.

71
00:06:32,909 --> 00:06:39,720
By June 1778, France and Britain were officially at war, and suddenly it was a whole new ballgame.

72
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:46,950
So that covers the French reaction to Saratoga. But what about the British? As I said, the French were

73
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:51,240
really concerned that we're going to defeat meant that the British would soon be throwing in the towel.

74
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:58,230
And indeed, Saratoga did pretty fundamentally rock the boat back in London, and invite some major criticisms

75
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:03,659
of the ministry. By this point, Lord North was sick of being Prime Minister and looking for a way out.

76
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:08,610
But he was trapped in office by King George who was starting to really dig his heels in on crushing

77
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:14,490
the Americans at all costs, not backing down, and not giving into weak willed backbenchers in Parliament,

78
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:17,790
who were taking unpatriotic potshots at his government.

79
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:24,120
But the Kings Full speed ahead, attitude aside, there were serious questions about how the war was being

80
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:30,120
waged. The spring of 1778 is approaching. So we're now three years past Lexington and Concord.

81
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:34,650
And not only the colonial still fighting, but we just lost 10,000 guys in upstate New York.

82
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:39,870
So what the heck is going on over there? Obviously, it was time for heads to start rolling.

83
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:43,980
And obviously the first man led to the scaffold was General William Howe.

84
00:07:44,909 --> 00:07:50,430
He had long faced understandable criticisms for his less than zealous conduct in the colonies.

85
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:54,419
Time and again, the Americans had been beaten only to slip away.

86
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:58,919
Then, of course, there was his decision to head for Philadelphia when he should have been coordinating

87
00:07:58,919 --> 00:08:02,700
with Burgoyne. And then there was his conduct in Philadelphia over the winter.

88
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:08,340
He spent the months in such a lavish and carefree ease, that Washington remarked that how did not capture

89
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:16,050
Philadelphia, so much as Philadelphia captured how so in March 1778 How was recalled though, he wouldn't

90
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:20,640
leave until May, and Henry Clinton was promoted to commander in chief.

91
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:25,980
Which brings us to the third of our triumvirate of reputation.

92
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:32,340
Henry Clinton was born in maybe 1730, though apparently we don't really know.

93
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:36,690
But whatever the real day, he was the youngest of the three main British generals.

94
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:42,059.
His father was an admiral in the Navy had been appointed governor of New York when young Henry was about

95
00:08:42,059. --> 00:08:45,180
12. And so the whole family picked up and moved to America.

96
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:50,580
Clinton started up the ranks of the army while living in New York, but there's only so far you can go

97
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:55,290
in the colonies, just ask George Washington, and he returned to Britain in 1749.

98
00:08:56,250 --> 00:09:01,110
Clinton wound up serving in Germany during the Seven Years War, and he became well acquainted with a

99
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:06,120
number of the officers who wound up serving on both sides of the American Revolution, including Charles

100
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:12,720
Lee, and the man who's about to become his second in command, Lord Cornwallis, Clinton and Cornwallis

101
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:18,090
with us long time comrades in arms when the Revolutionary War broke out, but whatever friendship they

102
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:23,100
shared was about to be destroyed by the stress of trying to defeat this confounded rebellion.

103
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:27,210
In less than a year, they will barely be on speaking terms.

104
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,130
But the change in top commanders was only part of the British ministries refocused war effort.

105
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:38,820
With nothing in the north having thus far worked at all.

106
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:44,070
The ministry decided to literally come at this from a different angle, and head for the southern colonies

107
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:50,250
where loyalists were supposedly plentiful. The new plan was to win over the South without too much difficulty,

108
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:53,610
and then push steadily north and tell the rebellion was choked out.

109
00:09:54,360 --> 00:10:00,540
But as we've seen, running a war from 3000 miles away is really hard and they'll report have strong

110
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:05,340
loyalist sentiment in the south where true. Those reports failed to mention that there was also strong

111
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:11,310
patriot sentiment, patriot sentiment that existed for its own reasons, independent of any grievances

112
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:16,740
of the New Englanders and the middle colonists. So as we will see next week, the plan to win the South

113
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:20,700
would prove no less difficult than any other attempts the British made to win the war.

114
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:25,830
Because despite the persistent belief in London that this whole rebellion was the work of a small band

115
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:31,830
of hardcore radicals. Support for the American war effort was in fact, both deep and widespread and

116
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:39,330
plentiful in the south. But of course, as the ministry was trying to alter its focus, it was hit with

117
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:42,060
the broadside that the French were joining the Americans.

118
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:48,569
So in response, British eyes moved even further south down to the West Indies, were plans were hatched

119
00:10:48,569 --> 00:10:53,460
to start attacking French colonial holdings and make them rue the day that they stepped into this Anglo

120
00:10:53,460 --> 00:11:00,390
family squabble. But that meant that they also now had to keep an eye on the home islands less the French

121
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:05,250
take advantage of British concentration of forces in the Americas to attack across the English Channel.

122
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:08,790
The ministry was divided on how seriously to take this threat.

123
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:14,010
And so once again, they started pumping out orders that wound up being both incoherent and insufficient,

124
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:20,670
because they now had four things they were trying to do at once, defend the home islands try and prevent

125
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:26,310
the French from sending a fleet to America attack French positions in the West Indies, and of course,

126
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:32,190
defeat the American rebels. But they did not really have the resources to do all of this at once.

127
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:36,060
And so every time they focused on one thing, they wound up neglecting another.

128
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:41,730
This is for example, how the French fleet was able to cross the Atlantic more or less done a post, because

129
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:44,730
running a tight blockade would pull too many ships out of the channel.

130
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:49,650
And it's why Henry Clinton started getting orders to transfer men down to the West Indies.

131
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:55,560
man he really shouldn't be transferring if they actually expected him to win the war against the rebels.

132
00:11:57,690 --> 00:12:04,980
While all of this was unfolding in the courts of Europe over the winter of 1777 1778, George Washington

133
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:09,030
and his beleaguered army we're suffering at Valley Forge Pennsylvania.

134
00:12:10,319 --> 00:12:16,530
80 miles northwest of Philadelphia, Washington selected the spot for a variety of reasons, was on easily

135
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:21,630
defensible high ground, it was distant enough to be out of the way of both the British and potentially

136
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:26,940
disgruntled civilians, while simultaneously being close enough should the ladder need protection from

137
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:33,600
the former general how had more or less holed up in Philadelphia in October, but in early December,

138
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,690
he marched out to try to steal a victory for the year was out.

139
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:42,150
But finding the American position at White Marsh too strong he retired for the year and as it would

140
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:47,010
turn out for the war, with the British now officially snug in their beds.

141
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:50,490
Continentals went off to Valley Forge to sleep on the ground.

142
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:58,470
The army that struggled into the absolutely nothing they found it Valley Forge numbered about 11,000.

143
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:04,560
And when I say nothing, there was just nothing. The first thing they had to do was construct a little

144
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:09,300
rudimentary huts that they could cram themselves into the floor was bare ground.

145
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:16,380
The beds were bare ground for nourishment, and soldiers live pretty much nonstop on a delicacy dubbed

146
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:21,030
fire cake, which was flour mixed with water and heated on rock.

147
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:27,240
That's it flour and water for like months on end. And there were a few times especially in February

148
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:31,350
1778 when even the flour ran out, and they just had nothing.

149
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:38,580
Washington spent the winter begging, pleading and demanding more and better suppliers from both the

150
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:43,800
civilians and Congress. The officers running his supply chain but kept getting nothing.

151
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:50,130
The Congress more or less punted its responsibilities and simply authorised Washington to commandeer

152
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:54,930
what he needed. But Washington was basically too smart to fall into that trap.

153
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:59,819
As we've seen, George Washington is a mixed bag when it comes to his general ship.

154
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:05,280
But one thing he never lost sight of was that he was fighting a political war and could not afford to

155
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:12,780
alienate the population. He was, for example, really super hard like summary execution hard on looters

156
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:19,230
and thieves in his ranks. resorting to forced requisitions might temporarily strengthen his army, but

157
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:25,710
it also might permanently weaken the overall war effort that he held as firmly as he could to this principle

158
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:30,140
in the face of his own armies.depravations and the knowledge that many of the locals were as we speak

159
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:34,190
selling supplies to the British in Philadelphia. nothing short of remarkable.

160
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,710
It's not to say he wasn't basically running on liquid fury during the month at Valley Forge.

161
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:43,550
Just that his composure through it all is damn near superhuman.

162
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:51,470
If there was a silver lining to the winter at Valley Ford was the arrival of the Prussian Baron Friedrich

163
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:57,680
Wilhelm Auguste Heinrich Ferdinand von stuben, who showed up with a glowing letter of introduction from

164
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:03,740
Benjamin Franklin and resume that said former lieutenant general and aid decamp to Frederick great,

165
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:08,300
which Wow, that is an impressive resume. Except Oh yeah, it's completely made up.

166
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:14,300
stuben does appear to have briefly served in Frederick's army maybe 20 years before the revolution broke

167
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:20,330
out, but that was about it. He was however charismatic and knowledgeable about how to run an army.

168
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:25,340
So when he met Benjamin Franklin in France, Franklin helped him exaggerate his credentials in order

169
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:31,040
to get Washington's attention. And once he had Washington's attention, the small matter of the bald faced

170
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:34,069.
lies he told to get him there, became insignificant.

171
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:40,190
Because Washington was desperate for somebody who knew how to drill an army, and stuben knew how to

172
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:47,000
drill an army. The Baron was given command of a model company whose example would then be used to teach

173
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:52,970
the rest of the army. Unfortunately, stupid did not speak English, and no one in camp spoke German.

174
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:58,760
But he did speak French as an American officer. So stuben took two calling instructions in French and

175
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:01,520
having the French immediately translated into English.

176
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:05,000
Now this, as you can imagine, was an awkward way of doing business.

177
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:11,180
But luckily, when the troops messed up, stupid would descend into these red faced fit laced with heavy

178
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:15,680
doses of German cussing, which the men found understandably hilarious.

179
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:20,030
So the drilling with the Baron lighten the mood of an otherwise dreary camp.

180
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:26,090
The men also came to love Him because despite his temper stupid, never tried to play the Martin net

181
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:31,520
with them. After making the keen observation that in Europe, he tells a soldier do this and he does it.

182
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:35,750
But in America, you have to say do this, here's why you do it.

183
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:41,360
And then they do it. In short order, the men learn what the Baron had to teach them.

184
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:47,420
And they all knew why they were doing it. The men spending the winter in Valley Forge were for the most

185
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:53,150
part all veterans of the previous year's campaigns, and they had discovered it both Brandywine and Germantown.

186
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:57,530
The discipline in the field was often the difference between life and death.

187
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:04,130
They were eager to master what the Prussian officer taught in between his fits of incomprehensible German

188
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:11,780
profanity. Now since we're on the subject of European officers serving in the American army, we should

189
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:16,880
probably introduce another man who like Thomas Paine, who will be joining us for the French Revolution.

190
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:22,460
The Marquis de Lafayette. No, I am not going to try to wrestle his full name to the ground.

191
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:30,110
A lot yet wasn't it idealistic 17 year old noble when the American Revolution broke out, and an idealistic

192
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:35,690
19 year old noble when he disobeyed a direct order from King Louie and hopped on a ship to seek fame,

193
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:38,600
Glory and Honour in the struggle for American independence.

194
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:44,780
Now, haven't talked about this, but when he first arrived, Lafayette was just another in an endless

195
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:50,270
line of French soldiers of fortune, who showed up on Congress's doorstep looking for fame, Glory and

196
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:56,240
Honour. They all expected to be made major generals and given fat salaries by these amateur colonials.

197
00:17:56,660 --> 00:18:00,260
But mostly, they were just a nuisance that the Americans could not afford.

198
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:05,960
Washington otterly detested them. But Lafayette turned out to be different.

199
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:13,070
Because yes, he expected a rank be fitting his noble status, but he asked for no salary, no salary.

200
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:17,510
Okay, well, you can be a major general and we don't have to pay you right.

201
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:24,410
When Lafayette showed up in Washington's camp in August 1777 so this is just before Brandywine.

202
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:28,880
Washington was annoyed that he had yet another pompous French officer to placate.

203
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:32,450
But as they reviewed the camp, then Washington apologised for it.

204
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:39,500
Sorry state. Lafayette allegedly said I come here to learn not to teach, which pretty much won over

205
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:46,190
Washington and we don't have to pay you right. From then on Lafayette was in Washington's inner circle.

206
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:51,200
Though it wasn't really clear what his rank was. Congress thought the general ship it had to be stowed

207
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:56,510
on this French teenager honorary, but Lafayette believe that he really was a major general would be

208
00:18:56,510 --> 00:19:01,850
given a field command as soon as General Washington decided that he was ready for it to report further

209
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:09,110
ingratiated him with Washington. Lafayette fought at and was wounded at Brandywine but delivered exemplary

210
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:13,340
service when he held the rallying point that made an orderly retreat possible.

211
00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:21,290
Now as we go forward, a Lafayette will continue to serve with distinction, even as he makes his mistakes

212
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:27,380
along the way. And he's gone down in American history as a fairly beloved hero of the revolution, is

213
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:32,930
returned to Earth through the states in 1824 was a national sensation that stands as a whole historical

214
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:40,010
episode in its own right. And it's why there's a Lafayette Square or park or circle or Avenue, and practically

215
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:46,190
every American city, which is all fascinating to me just now because I'm pretty deep into reading about

216
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:52,220
the French Revolution. And really, no historian of the French Revolution has anything good to say about

217
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:57,980
the Marquis de Lafayette generally gets ridiculed as a vainglorious, incompetent jackass.

218
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:03,260
It's really quite something how Different the treatment of Lafayette becomes depending on which revolution

219
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:11,000
we're talking about. Now the other thing Washington had to deal with while huddled in Valley Forge was

220
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,060
a nascent movement to have him replaced as commander in chief.

221
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:21,080
Let's face it, he had basically nothing to show for his years on campaign, the small island, Trenton

222
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:27,230
in a sea of defeats and retreats. sure he's kept his army together even though we don't feed it or give

223
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:34,010
it clothes or shelter. But we need a man who can win a battle, you know, like her ratio gates.

224
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:41,690
And this very loose movement is known to history as the Conway cabal gets its name from an Irish Brigadier

225
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:47,090
General named Thomas Conway, who had been fighting under Washington during the campaigns in Pennsylvania,

226
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:52,070
and was fairly well disgusted with what he decided was Washington's rank amateurism.

227
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:58,820
Shortly after Germantown, Conway began lobbying Congress for a promotion to Major General and use the

228
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:05,930
opportunity to criticise Washington relentlessly. He also wrote to other leading officers and congressmen

229
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:11,780
who shared his attitude including her ratio gate. But all of this carping came to nothing.

230
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:18,620
Washington still had plenty of friends who informed him of everything everyone had been saying, when

231
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:24,590
their words hit the sunlight, Conway lost his command, AND gates denied furiously having any part of

232
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:29,960
it. And that was the end of the only real attempt to get rid of Washington during the war.

233
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:34,160
Whatever his failings, he was the keystone of the whole project.

234
00:21:34,639 --> 00:21:43,820
Always had been, and now always would be. When the spring of 1778 finally arrived, Washington couldn't

235
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:46,490
wait to get his newly drilled army into the field.

236
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:51,920
And it looked like his new counterpart Henry Clinton, was going to give him a fat opportunity right

237
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:58,010
away. With the French fleet on the way, Clinton decided that trying to hold Philadelphia was pointless,

238
00:21:58,190 --> 00:22:03,200
and it was time to head back for the far more defensible New York City stage to move to the southern

239
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:09,320
colonies from there. At the end of May, Washington sent out Lafayette with 2200 men to scout around

240
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:14,120
Philadelphia, and keep an eye on the British so he would know the minute they tried to march away.

241
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:20,210
Lafayette's first taste of an independent command nearly ended in disaster when he was almost trapped

242
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:24,860
at barren Hill. But he definitely manoeuvred his men out of danger before the walls close in.

243
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:30,320
He did report there was no doubt that the British were preparing to evacuate Philadelphia.

244
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:37,520
The question, what would the Americans do about it? Almost alone among his senior commanders Washington

245
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:44,300
wanted to attack. The most prominent dissenter to this idea was the recently returned from British custody,

246
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:50,210
Charles Lee. Now back at the table, Lee basically said if the British want to leave without a fight,

247
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:57,139
we should build them a road paved with gold. It seems clear by this point, that Lee has pretty much

248
00:22:57,139 --> 00:23:00,500
lost faith in the American ability to actually defeat the British.

249
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:05,540
And there is good reason to believe that he spent his time in British custody, providing his captors

250
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:08,690
with all kinds of information about his supposed comrades.

251
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:14,210
But Washington would not back down and he was supported by both stuben and Lafayette.

252
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:20,030
The slow moving and heavily laden British caravan would be a sitting duck ripe for the plucking.

253
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:25,730
Now, all things being equal, I think Washington's instincts were exactly right.

254
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:32,210
His big mistake, though, was putting Charles Lee in anything resembling a key role.

255
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:39,620
After putting the men who were too sick to travel in about 3000 terrified loyalists on ships to New

256
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:46,010
York, Henry Clinton set out with somewhere between 10 and 12,000 men and about 1500 carts on June the

257
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:51,830
18th 1778. The train moves slow even by the standards of the day.

258
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,840
This was after all the entire operational infrastructure of the British Army.

259
00:23:56,770 --> 00:24:02,170
As it plotted through New Jersey, Washington gathered his 13,000 men and led them out of Valley Forge

260
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:08,500
in pursuit. A Clinton did not want to wind up like Burgoyne, and he worried endlessly about getting

261
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:14,590
attacked, who because he believed erroneously as it turned out, that her ratio gauge would be coming

262
00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:20,080
down from the north. So when he spied a river crossing he didn't like the look of, he turned off the

263
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:24,310
most direct route to New York and instead put himself on a road that would lead him through Monmouth

264
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:31,090
courthouse. Critically, the road he was now on forced him to bunches army in a single file, with a small

265
00:24:31,090 --> 00:24:37,510
Vanguard out in front, the baggage in the middle and a strong rear guard led by Lord Cornwallis, really

266
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:44,200
the bulk of the army. On June the 26th, the British reached monolith courthouse which is about halfway

267
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:49,780
to New York. The American army was now just 10 miles to the west, but the next day both sides rested

268
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:55,960
in the scorching June heat. Washington though and determined to get at the British sent forward and

269
00:24:55,960 --> 00:25:00,430
advanced army of about 5000 men under the command of Wait for it.

270
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:06,790
General Charles Lee, and more or less ordered Lee to pin down the rear guard if they tried to move.

271
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:13,690
I say more or less ordered because Washington had also said that if there was some dire emergency at

272
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:19,150
Lee could pull back, or Washington meant was if you get there and it turns out that like the entire

273
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:22,240
British army is massed in a line waiting to mow you down.

274
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:25,540
The No, I'm not ordering you on a suicidal attack.

275
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:29,920
But what Lee appears to have heard is don't attack if you don't feel like it.

276
00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:34,000
And as we've already noted, Lee was not into this plan at all.

277
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:37,180
He had initially refused the command of the forward army.

278
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:42,820
But when Washington offered it to Lafayette, Lee's ego bristled, and he decided to take the advance

279
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:49,060
force after all, but he was going to be on a sharp lookout for any dire emergencies.

280
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:54,370
On the morning of June 28, Lee moved forward with his attack.

281
00:25:54,820 --> 00:26:00,130
But before he moved, he broke up his forces while simultaneously giving his officers no clear instructions

282
00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:06,130
about what they were supposed to be doing. The Battle of Monmouth courthouse has a lot of moving parts,

283
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:09,130
so I'm going to simplify all of this as much as possible.

284
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:14,830
When the first batch of Americans made contact with the British rear guard, a bout of intense fighting

285
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:21,010
commenced and oh look a dire emergency. Lee ordered the forward units to pull back and they were still

286
00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:24,610
in good order. But the other scattered units didn't know what was happening.

287
00:26:24,610 --> 00:26:27,700
They saw the retreat, and everyone started to break and run.

288
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:33,580
As Washington game up the road, he was flabbergasted to suddenly find himself consumed by a wave of

289
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:38,320
fleeing soldiers. He was doubly flabbergasted to find generally among them.

290
00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:43,690
In what appears to be practically the only time in recorded history this ever happened.

291
00:26:43,690 --> 00:26:50,170
George Washington lost his temper, and cursed Lee with every curse word in the book and George Washington

292
00:26:50,170 --> 00:26:57,160
does not curse. Lee tried to spider his excuses, but Washington relieved him of command, rerouting the

293
00:26:57,160 --> 00:27:01,450
fleeing units, and got them to hold the line while the rest of the American army set up for a pitch

294
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:07,330
battle. Meanwhile, Lee was already back working on that offence that would get him absolutely nowhere

295
00:27:07,330 --> 00:27:13,480
with the court martial he faced in August, Washington made damn sure that this was the end of General

296
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:21,880
Charles Lee. When cornwalls came on in hot pursuit of the fleeing rebels, he suddenly hit a solid wall

297
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:26,530
of continental forces. He made a run at the American left but was pushed back.

298
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:31,120
He made a run at the American right but was pushed back there to in the centre.

299
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:37,150
The American line protected by a hedge row, repulse three successive attacks until the fourth finally

300
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:39,460
forced them to abandon their position and fall back.

301
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:44,920
But the mutual heavy beatings precluded any further advances by either side.

302
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:50,110
And after a few hours of shelling each other, Cornwallis led his men back up the road.

303
00:27:50,770 --> 00:27:54,820
Washington wanted to press on, the darkness forced him to hold still.

304
00:27:57,100 --> 00:28:02,610
So the Battle of Monmouth was basically a draw.Though, I think, technically, the British get the tactical

305
00:28:02,610 --> 00:28:07,560
victory, because Cornwallis was able to prevent Washington from capturing the train, and the British

306
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:12,990
were able to complete their run for New York. But at the same time, the Americans held the field of

307
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:19,470
battle. They had been hit head on by the cream of the British regular army and stood firm had it taken

308
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:25,200
a few years, but Washington finally had the army he had always dreamed of, which is why it's so kind

309
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:30,060
of tragically hilarious that the Battle of Monmouth was the last major battle George Washington would

310
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:34,980
take part in until Yorktown fully three years away, seriously.

311
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:42,600
Next week, we will begin to see why Washington wound up on the bench as the British follow through on

312
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:48,810
their plan to move the war south. There they expected to be welcomed with open arms by a loyal population.

313
00:28:49,290 --> 00:28:52,890
When they got there, it turned out that those reports of loyalists were only half right.

314
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:57,720
And what was actually going on in the south was a fairly better little civil war between loyalist and

315
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:03,150
patriot militias, and the British regular forces were about to find themselves trapped in the middle

316
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:03,360
of it.
