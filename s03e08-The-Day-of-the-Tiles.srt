14
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:39,190
Today of the tiles. Last week, we saw the Royal ministry and the Paris Parliament battle over the big

15
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:43,120
financial reform package that had been cooked up to save the kingdom's bacon.

16
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:49,180
After accepting a few of the initial offerings. The Parliament then rejected the main pieces of the

17
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:55,660
puzzle, leading to a series of showdowns between the summer of 1787 and the spring of 1788.

18
00:01:56,440 --> 00:02:01,840
To many an outside observer, it looked like the parliamo was gaining the upper hand, they had forced

19
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,350
the king to withdraw the stamp tax and stop pursuing the land tax.

20
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:07,990
And we're riding high on a wave of public acclaim.

21
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:12,370
But the Kings ministers are not yet ready to just give up completely.

22
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:18,220
And this week, we will see them make one last push to assert the kings will in the face of Parliament,

23
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:22,690
obstructionism, their solution, destroy the parliament.

24
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,550
But before we get into that, I want to backtrack a little and briefly cover the reaction of the provincial

25
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:35,490
parliament to Brian's reforms. Because though Paris was the centre of the action, there was lots of

26
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:41,310
noise being made out on the periphery, that will have a huge impact on what will happen in today's episode.

27
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:48,690
So let's wind back the clock to June 1787, when Brienne first started bringing in the reforms to the

28
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:55,470
Paris parliament. Now, as you will maybe recall, Brienne started with what I called the easy stuff,

29
00:02:55,470 --> 00:03:01,740
turning the korovai into a money tax that seemed fine lifting regulations on the green trade, which will

30
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:07,320
I can promise you be hated by the lower classes. But remember, we're still talking about the Uber elite

31
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:11,970
here. They saw a more rational and more profitable system and said, Yeah, let's do it.

32
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:18,930
Then finally, the magistrate accepted the creation of provincial assemblies to assess and collect taxes.

33
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:24,270
Now, this breeze through the Paris Parliament who had little to fear and much to gain from these new

34
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:29,700
assemblies, and most of the areas under the jurisdiction of the Paris parliament, tax collection was

35
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:34,110
all handled by the royally appointed intendant and the much despised tax farmers.

36
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:40,770
So injecting a new institution composed of the wealthiest taxpayers like you know, us, was a welcomed

37
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:47,110
devolution of power. But in the outer provinces, where the parliament has already enjoyed a great deal

38
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:52,750
of autonomy, these new assemblies did not look to the local magistrates, like more power was being given

39
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:56,230
to them, but rather that power was being taken away.

40
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:02,800
They were further incensed when they saw the specifics of the plan, specifically, that there were no

41
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:08,860
specifics. The edict they were presented with was vague about both the jurisdiction and the scope of

42
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:16,500
the new assemblies. Plus, the order came with a really suspicious kicker, because the assemblies needed

43
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:22,050
to get to work right away, and it would take too long to set up the whole tiered process of lesser taxpayers

44
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:28,050
electing greater taxpayers to go represent them. The first members of the assemblies would be wait for

45
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:35,550
it, appointed by the king. In this, the provincial Parliament smelled a big, fat hairy rat.

46
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,380
complaints about the provincial assemblies were drawn up by the several regional Parliament with varying

47
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:46,450
degrees of intensity, usually arguing that the ministry was doing an end run around the long established

48
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:52,810
political constitution of France. But more than that, they were also just kind of opposed to the whole

49
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:58,990
idea of tax reform in the first place. Up until now, we've been talking about the Royal ministry.

50
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,550
The assembly of notables and the Paris parliament.

51
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:09,990
And in each of those three places, we've seen men either resigned to or openly pushing for a new tax

52
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:16,050
system. So for the first time now we're actually hitting on some nobles who were flat out against giving

53
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:21,630
up their tax privileges. These provincial nobles were not the super nobles living in Versailles and

54
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:27,030
Paris, they actually relied on their land to make up the bulk of their often meagre income, rather than

55
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:32,850
enjoying rich diversified portfolios, to say nothing of the fact that if this kept up there would be

56
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:38,580
very little to mark them out as special, whose tax privileges were a social calling card that they were

57
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:44,480
not prepared to give up of the Parliament that resisted the creation of the provincial assemblies.

58
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:50,270
The one that needs to be highlighted right now is the Parliament of Porto, monta scuse old stomping

59
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:56,510
ground. They were the political and judicial hub of a fairly prosperous port city that had long enjoyed

60
00:05:56,510 --> 00:06:03,050
a great deal of autonomy. In July 1787, they issued a remonstrance back to the king saying that they

61
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:08,570
refuse to register the edict establishing the new provincial assemblies, until the jurisdiction and

62
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:13,159
scope of those assemblies was clearly laid out, which for the moment really wasn't.

63
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:19,460
They were stiff enough in their resistance that when the Paris parliament was exiled in August 1787,

64
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:26,060
the Bordeaux parliament was given the boot to letras de cachet exiled them from the regional capital

65
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:32,420
for the small town of libran. But unlike their brother magistrates in Paris, the exile did not make

66
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:35,659
them amenable to a compromise. It only made them matter.

67
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:41,210
So when the Paris parliament was recalled in September, the Bordeaux Parliament stayed in exile.

68
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:46,790
They would not be allowed to return home until just before the main edicts were issued, which were designed

69
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:54,330
to make them irrelevant. Despite the resistance though, the provincial assemblies began to convene in

70
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:59,820
November 1787 justice The king was going off script in the middle of that royal session we talked about

71
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:05,650
last time. As I mentioned, this first batch of assemblies were indeed appointed by the Royal ministry.

72
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:12,280
So the entire apparatus was obviously suspect, but just how suspect came down to how strongly the members

73
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:18,220
actually favoured the king. Because not everyone in the assembly was a staunch royal ally, there just

74
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:23,440
weren't enough of those guys to go around. Some of the members were there to do the king's bidding for

75
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:29,080
sure. But others wound up full of guys like for example, the Marquis de Lafayette, who were eager to

76
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:34,330
steer the assemblies in the direction of independent mindedness, and most especially serving as yet

77
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:37,840
another stage to advocate for the calling of the estates general.

78
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,130
With Brienne, having dropped the land tax as a part of his compromise with the Paris parliament, the

79
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:50,320
one order of business the assemblies really had to haggle over was the extension and collection of the

80
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:54,670
VA tm, which was supposed to once again help bridge the rail deficit.

81
00:07:55,570 --> 00:07:58,480
But where lacks collection had long been the order of the day.

82
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:02,740
The VA tm was now supposed to be pursued with an unprecedented vigour.

83
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:10,810
So over the winter of 1787 1788, the Royal ministry, the provincial parliament, the intendant, the provincial

84
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:17,320
assemblies, all waged a running battle with each other over who owed what and for how long? And of course,

85
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:24,610
the big question, who now outranked whom the parliament still wanted assurances that the taxes would

86
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:28,240
have to be duly registered before the assemblies could set to work collecting them.

87
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:31,540
The assemblies generally ignored this and just went to work.

88
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:36,250
But more than a few got to work simply so they can drag their feet and force the king to call the estates

89
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:41,710
general. Meanwhile, Brienne threatened to go back to arbitrarily assessing and collecting the VTM if

90
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:46,450
the assemblies didn't get in gear, and then another flood of angry remonstrance is from the parliament

91
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:54,460
would come pouring in the spring of 1788 approached, this mess needed to be simplified, so Brian's ministry

92
00:08:54,460 --> 00:09:00,010
decided to cut at least one tangle out of a knot. by just taking the parliament out of the equation.

93
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:07,750
It was as audacious a move as Chancellor mapu had made back in the early 1770s, if not more audacious

94
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:13,510
for Brianna and his colleagues. The hope was that when they were done, the parliament, the self proclaimed

95
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:18,280
defenders of French liberty, would be turned into an insignificant Social Club.

96
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,860
The setup for this came at the end of last week's episode when rumours started flying around in April

97
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:29,150
1788 that the ministry was about to make a really serious move.

98
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:34,610
This resulted in even more heated rhetoric coming out of the Paris parliament, and then the rest of

99
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:41,300
the premier Neil and that other guy, then on May the eighth, the wild rumours were confirmed by a sweeping

100
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:47,570
series of decrees that basically gutted the power of the Parliament, known as the may eat acts.

101
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:52,490
These decrees set up a new plenary court that would be staffed by high ranking nobles.

102
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:58,220
This new plenary court would become the institution where all future taxes and legislation would be

103
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:04,140
registered and come to court of final appeal for almost all criminal and civil cases.

104
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:11,280
All that was left to the parliament were cases involving sums over 20,000 Libra, and a few other estate

105
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:14,970
and contract issues that affected only the richest men in the kingdom.

106
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:21,810
In one bold stroke, the ministry was trying to reduce the parliament to little more than an arbitration

107
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:27,690
Council for the super rich, all real power and authority would be transferred to the plenary court.

108
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:33,630
And as if this wasn't shocking enough, begin further plan to create lesser courts over the next few

109
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:37,980
years to replace the existing hodgepodge of weirdly overlapping jurisdictions.

110
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:44,460
If all went according to plan, France would shortly have an entirely new judicial system, and the parliament

111
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:52,690
would become relics of a bygone age. Now Brian was of course expecting some resistance, but it seems

112
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:57,010
pretty clear that he underestimated just how widespread that resistance would be.

113
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:01,900
The Kings principle minister was no doubt thinking about the parliament, as they truly were.

114
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:06,640
Little enclaves of aristocratic privilege, cared a little about the general welfare.

115
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,170
But by now the parliament had morphed into something far greater in the public imagination.

116
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:17,960
It would appear that all they're bloviating, about protecting the ancient liberties of France was actually

117
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:23,210
being taken seriously. The Parliament were for the moment, the one institution in the kingdom who could

118
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:27,050
resist the king's will, and then send him remonstrance is explaining why.

119
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:32,480
So when the king tried to abolish the parliament, well, as we'll see in a minute, everyone from the

120
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,530
highest noble to the lowliest fishmonger had something to say about it.

121
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:42,560
Although as we will also see, when the magistrates of the Parliament notice that the unwashed masses

122
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:46,040
were jumping into the fight, they will get really super uncomfortable.

123
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:51,620
Because when we said we were the defenders of liberty, we meant our liberty you dummies, not yours.

124
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:53,720
Oh crap, that one's got to break Let's run for it.

125
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:01,690
So what this led to in the summer of 1788, was a series of protests, demonstrations and riots that knock

126
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:06,880
the ministry back on its heels, and it all got started almost immediately after the main effects were

127
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:12,700
announced. First of all, the parliament were collectively put on vacation, whereupon almost the entire

128
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:17,290
legal profession went on strike and protest, the wheels of justice ground to a halt.

129
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,800
Unlike last time, when mobu was able to entice ambitious young attorneys into the new system, though

130
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:30,310
Brienne found almost no takers. The solidarity of the legal community was for the moment, unbreakable.

131
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:36,160
But though they had been ordered to disperse, not all the parliament were willing to just go away without

132
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:40,300
a fight. Some disperse quietly after a token remonstrance or two.

133
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:45,790
But once again, those on the periphery of the kingdom elected the path of stiff resistance.

134
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:51,850
When, for example, the local intendant came to prevent the Parliament of a friend from meeting, he was

135
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:55,450
met by an angry mob of such size and force that he was forced to flee.

136
00:12:55,780 --> 00:13:00,250
And whenever authority the monarchy hadn't Brittany was basically lost for good two months.

137
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:07,180
But the most famous incident happened down in the city of Grenoble, the traditional capital of the province

138
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:13,180
of ruffini, down on the edge of the Alps. When the authorities there attempted to disperse the Grenoble,

139
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:17,140
a parliament. What they got was the day of the tiles.

140
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,580
The Grenoble, a parliament had outright called the main edicts illegal until Brienne ordered them exiled

141
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:31,970
from the city letras de cache were issued and due to be delivered June the seventh 1788.

142
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:39,290
Now the problem delivering the exile orders on June the seventh was it it was a Saturday, aka market

143
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:46,070
day. That meant that granola was full to the brim with people who were already a bit agitated over rising

144
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:51,920
bread prices and lack of work. the closure of the Parliament would mean that granola would take yet

145
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:57,140
another economic hit. So all morning speakers railed against the injustice of it all.

146
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:02,690
And around 10am everyone shut up their stalls to get down for a little direct action.

147
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:08,330
One group went to the Palais Royale to prevent the magistrates from leaving, a second group went to

148
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:13,280
the city gates to ensure the same and then a third group convened at the governor's house and basically

149
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:19,830
laid siege to it. The authorities had on hand two regiments of soldiers to try to quell the unrest,

150
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:25,800
but torn between the twin evils of attacking unarmed civilians and letting anarchy reign, they opted

151
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,890
for a halfway measure that just made everything worse.

152
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:35,880
Soldiers were dispatched in small groups to establish a presence, but told not to fire on the demonstrators.

153
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:41,550
The effect of this was to make it look like the protesters were about to be attacked, while leaving

154
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:46,350
the soldiers totally outnumbered and without any means of protecting themselves if the people started

155
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:52,620
to get out of hand. Now most of the troops managed to hang tough and not fire into the unruly crowds.

156
00:14:53,100 --> 00:15:00,600
But one group near the Jesuit college building found itself pelted by debris from all sides then pelted

157
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:06,900
with roof piles from the building above. When they actually started getting hit, it was much too much

158
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:13,580
and they started firing into the crowd. This of course, only confirmed to everyone in the city that

159
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:19,250
they were indeed under attack. And they rang the toxin bells, which drew in even more men and women from

160
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:23,780
the countryside. The authorities then tried to cut a deal with the magistrates of the Parliament and

161
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:26,360
say, Look, we'll pull back if you just leave the city.

162
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:30,020
The magistrates of the Parliament said yeah, well that sounds awesome.

163
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:32,840
But unfortunately, we're not really in control anymore.

164
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:38,780
We're frankly as freaked out by all of this as you are, with the mob, as you can see, has unbridled

165
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:44,520
all the carriages and is now manning the gate. But after peaking with a good old fashioned ransacking

166
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:50,940
of officials house, the demonstrators slash rioters started to naturally disperse as the sunset, at

167
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:56,130
which point, almost all the magistrates of the Paris parliament, re bridle their carriages, and got the

168
00:15:56,130 --> 00:16:04,490
heck out of town. The day of the tiles represents the first major incursion of the mob into our story,

169
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:10,130
and served as a rather Stark wake up call to the parliament that they were toying with Pandora's box

170
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:16,760
here. Remember, for the most part, what they wanted was to keep things the same, but they found themselves

171
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:20,180
now seized on as a vehicle for those who wanted change.

172
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:25,250
And now all of a sudden, these lower class yobbos, who had no business being anything but anonymous

173
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:31,880
plebs were violently getting in on the action. For the moment, these anonymous plebs were defending the

174
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:38,630
parliament as the people's champion. But how long could that possibly last? Spoiler alert, it will last

175
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:46,020
until about September. But though most of the magistrates of the Grenoble a parliament were disturbed

176
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:51,990
by the day of the titles, one guy saw at all as an opportunity to capitalise on the expose weakness

177
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:56,940
of the Royal authorities to demand more than just the continued existence of the Parliament.

178
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:05,930
That man was 30 year old john Joseph Mooney. Mooney was a wildly successful young judge ennobled at

179
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:09,470
the age of 25 after buying himself a place in the Grenoble parliament.

180
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:15,920
But despite his success, he was a forward thinker, and clearly wanted more than to just rise up the

181
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:20,060
old judicial hierarchy, both for his own sake and for the sake of France.

182
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:26,900
So he was the mastermind behind the movement to get the Dauphine a state to provincial recall a necessary

183
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:33,200
first step in what would hopefully become a wider movement to establish a sound constitutional monarchy

184
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:39,620
for France. Though he was out in front of events for the moment, munia would remain committed to the

185
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:43,550
dream of a constitutional monarchy even as events swept by him.

186
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:50,240
As we'll see, he'll enter the estates general as one of the most influential and genuinely recognisable

187
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:55,820
members, and then resigned from that body less than a year later, unable to reconcile himself to the

188
00:17:55,820 --> 00:18:02,480
pace and direction of events, then branded as a reactionary, he will be forced to slip away to Switzerland

189
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:08,450
in 1790. The French Revolution moves fast, but that is all still in the future.

190
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,690
For now, Mooney was in his prime on June the 14th.

191
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:19,000
A week after the day of the tiles he organised a meeting of about 100 prominent men representing each

192
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:25,570
of the three states. At moonies urging, the group endorsed a call for the restoration both of the Parliament

193
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:28,540
and for the convening of Duffin as a state to provincial.

194
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:35,910
But by far the most critical aspect of this meeting, is that it gave the first formal expression to

195
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:42,810
an idea that would soon sweep the country that when the estates met, as they surely must, the number

196
00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:47,100
of the third estates representatives should be double that of the other orders.

197
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:55,290
So the composition would wind up being 50% clergy and nobility and 50% third estate, and then critically,

198
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:58,950
that voting should be by head rather than by order.

199
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:06,000
This Maxim of double the third vote by head would become a major rallying cry in the lead up to the

200
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:12,060
estates general and when the issue still hadn't been resolved when these states finally meet in May 1789.

201
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:19,700
Well, you'll see what happens when we get there. While he waited for word from the Ministry about whether

202
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:25,250
the Dauphine estate would be allowed to meet munia simply plunged ahead as if they were going to say

203
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:31,460
yes, word went round Dauphine a for everyone to prepare for the calling of the estates provincial, and

204
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:34,940
to convene a preliminary assembly at a Chateau in Vizio.

205
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:44,210
meeting on July 21, this assembly was composed of 50 clergymen, 165 nobles, and 276 representatives

206
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:51,200
of the third estate. Monia got himself appointed secretary and then guided the debate into unprecedented

207
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:58,310
territory. Though he was not a great orator, his arguments carried enormous weight instead of making

208
00:19:58,310 --> 00:20:05,010
the case for power Lamar and the estates on the basis of the old constitution, he went back even further

209
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:10,920
than that into the primordial ooze and started bringing up points about natural law, the rights of man

210
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:16,530
and the necessity of true liberty. These were concepts that had been floating around for years among

211
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:21,570
the philosophic, but they were now being mainline directly into the body politic.

212
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:27,640
Then they went further, and said that no convening of the states provincial or the estates general could

213
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:33,460
be considered legitimate if it was not convened on the basis of double the third and vote by head.

214
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:37,990
And anyone who oppose that idea was a traitor to France.

215
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:44,500
And now we're talking revolutionary language because man, once these guys grab hold of the notion that

216
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:49,150
political opponents are actually guilty of treason, boy, watch out.

217
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,770
Meanwhile, back up in Paris, King Louie was of course vacillating like crazy.

218
00:20:56,340 --> 00:21:01,530
He had come down hard with the rest of deployment Neil and the main effects, but the size and scope

219
00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:07,740
of the pushback shocked him. For a minute he tried to keep up the tough guy act, group of Breton nobles

220
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:10,920
were thrown in jail for meeting under vaguely suspicious circumstances.

221
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:15,870
And then the delegation on the way from Ren to ask for their own estates provincial, was arrested.

222
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:21,120
But a week later, he backed down and suddenly agreed to let the Breton estates meet.

223
00:21:21,810 --> 00:21:27,390
Then on August the second, he more or less accepted the legitimacy of all Munoz activities by allowing

224
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:34,990
the Duffin estates to meet as well. Now, if you will recall from way back when the big problem with

225
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:38,320
King Charles The first was that he wouldn't listen to anyone.

226
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:43,720
He was so insanely inflexible that he basically forced Cromwell to cut off his head.

227
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:51,580
In this respect, Louie was the opposite. He was so flexible that he just couldn't stick with any one

228
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:58,240
policy. He was one of those guys who will just go with whatever the last person who talked said this

229
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:03,490
was starting to become a problem from a monarchy, and Marie Antoinette and the Kings brothers started

230
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:07,600
talking amongst themselves about how they were worried Louis might not be up for this.

231
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:13,870
The Queen then started taking a more forward role in policy to protect the interests of the royal family.

232
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:20,590
But unfortunately, all of this royalist entrenchment did was create an even more extreme position for

233
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:24,760
Louie to jump back and forth from when the state's general finally met.

234
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:32,130
The bottom finally fell out of the alcyone regime on August the eighth 1788.

235
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:38,700
That was when Brienne was informed that there was only 400,000 lever left in the Royal Treasury, barely

236
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:43,020
enough to keep the lights on for a single day, and no one would lend them any more money.

237
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:50,070
The ministry was forced to admit defeat, scrapping the plan to replace the parliament with the plenary

238
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:55,200
court, Brianna announced that the meeting of the estates general would no longer be at some vague point

239
00:22:55,200 --> 00:23:02,340
in the future. He announced that on May the first 1789, the estates general would convene at Versailles

240
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:10,890
for the first time in 175 years. This announcement was met by wild euphoria throughout the kingdom,

241
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:15,900
as everyone had come to believe that basically all their hearts desired would be granted by this now

242
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:22,200
almost mythical assembly. In a move that looks shrewd to Brienne, at the time, wound up really sowing

243
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:28,110
the seeds of true revolution. The King then invited public debate on the form the estate should take.

244
00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:34,110
This was supposed to drive a wedge between the nobility, who would insist on going by the old three

245
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:40,500
equal estate vote by order, and the commoners who were already on record opposing anything but doubling

246
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:48,410
the third and voting by head. Now it did indeed drive a wedge between them, but the resulting rupture

247
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:51,350
did not lead to the king regaining his political footing.

248
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:56,930
It opened up instead an unbridgeable chasm that would eventually cost the king his head.

249
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:04,760
But though the call to convene the estates general was for sure necessary to satisfy the Kings creditors.

250
00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:10,970
It was not sufficient. The regime needed loans to get them through until May 1789.

251
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:16,670
But as had happened with cat loan, Brienne was now personally becoming a sticking point.

252
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:23,390
On August the 16th, with credit exhaustion, were getting cut off repayment of loans and started issuing

253
00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:29,450
pieces of paper for the amounts to plus 5% interest, collectible at some point in the future.

254
00:24:30,290 --> 00:24:33,770
This was not a satisfactory response, and Brienne knew it.

255
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:40,940
But there was little he could do, beaten, tired, and now well aware that the regimes bankers were opposed

256
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:44,510
to him personally. He resigned on August the 25th.

257
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:52,250
He had spent 16 months trying to get somewhere anywhere, and instead God Himself nowhere and the kingdom

258
00:24:52,460 --> 00:25:01,290
officially on the road to revolution. With Brienne out of the picture, there was only One man the bankers

259
00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:04,950
would accept if the monarchy expected to see even a single lever.

260
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:08,760
That was of course the Swiss Wonderboy. Jacques Macare.

261
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:15,450
As much as the King hated it. He was forced to choose between the care and the care because there was

262
00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:21,120
no other choice. The news that the now hated Brienne was gone and the people's banker netcare was being

263
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:25,590
recalled. Set off yet another wave of jubilant celebration across the kingdom.

264
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:30,690
This is all going fantastically, don't you think? And now we get to have a great debate over how our

265
00:25:30,690 --> 00:25:34,440
estate should be composed. I mean, this really is the dawning of a new era.

266
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:41,480
And next week, we will dive into the dawning of that new era, with freedom of the press all but declared

267
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:48,350
France would be flooded with newspapers and pamphlets and diatribes all trying to influence public opinion

268
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:56,810
and sway the future of France. It was exhilarating, intoxicating, and ultimately would prove totally

269
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:58,160
uncontrollable.
