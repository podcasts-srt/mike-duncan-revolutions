00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:05,490
This week's episode is brought to you, by a way away, it was founded by two friends from

2
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:10,440
New York who found themselves at JFK with dead phones, delayed flights and a bright idea

3
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:12,330
luggage with power.

4
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:14,580
Thus the away carry-on was born.

5
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:19,260
The approach is simply to create special objects that are designed to be resilient,

6
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:22,610
resourceful and essential to the way you travel today.

7
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:27,090
They asked thousands of people how they pack, why they travel, and what bugs them most

8
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:31,230
about their luggage. And then a way designed a bag to solve a few old problems like

9
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:34,260
sticky wheels and a few new ones like dead cell phones.

10
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:39,600
With the way you get to choose from a variety of sizes and colors, there's the carry-on,

11
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:44,790
the bigger carry-on, the medium or the large, and both sizes of the carry-on are able to

12
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:49,110
charge all cell phones, tablets, e-readers or anything else that's powered by a U.S.

13
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:54,630
be called a single charge from an away carry on will charge your iPhone 5 times.

14
00:00:55,200 --> 00:01:00,000
All suitcases are also made from premium German polycarbonate unrivaled and strengthen

15
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,220
impact resistance and also very lightweight.

16
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:06,390
The interior features a patent pending compression system which is helpful for over

17
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:12,330
packers'. It has four 360 degree spinner wheels which guarantee a smooth ride and a TSA

18
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:16,230
approved combination lock is built into the top of the bag to prevent theft.

19
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,860
The away bag also comes with a lifetime warranty if anything breaks.

20
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:22,380
They will fix it or replace it for life.

21
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:25,590
And then there is the 100 day trial because you can live with it.

22
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,420
You can work with it. You can travel with it.

23
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:31,470
And if at any point you decide it's not for you, you can return it for a full refund with

24
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:32,730
no questions asked.

25
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:36,800
Our away travel back continues to be great for our world travels.

26
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:40,980
Lightweight design makes it easy to maneuver around sidewalks on and off the metro and

27
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:42,360
trains in and out of planes.

28
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:46,770
Then, on more than one occasion, the u_s_b_ power source has saved me from a dying cell

29
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:53,610
phone. So for $20 off a suitcase, visit a way, travel dot com slash revolutions 20 and

33
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,550
Hello and welcome to revolutions.

34
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:23,180
Episode ten point three, The Three Pillars of Marxism.

35
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:29,850
Before we get going this week, I want to thank everyone who came out to Waterstones last

36
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:31,630
Tuesday night. It was fantastic.

37
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:33,600
I had a great time. Hope you did, too.

38
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:37,230
And then I want to remind everybody that I will be flying to New York in a couple of

39
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:41,670
weeks to take part in a really cool event called Intelligent Speech, which is bringing

40
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:46,650
together a lot of podcasters and specifically history podcasters to talk about what we

41
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:49,860
do, why we do it, and maybe how you can do it, too.

42
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:54,660
This is all happening at the Center for Social Innovation in Chelsea on Saturday, June

43
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,430
the twenty eighth. Twenty nineteen.

44
00:02:56,850 --> 00:03:01,530
The details are an intelligent speech conference dot com and I put a link to it in the

45
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:05,970
show notes and I hope to see you there because I'll be there all day talking about what I

46
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:08,790
do and why I do it, and how maybe you can do it too.

47
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:15,490
But getting back to the show last time we talked through the lives of marks and angles.

48
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:21,400
Long story short, they were would be revolutionaries whose revolution came and then went

49
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,130
and then deposited them in exile in England.

50
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:29,440
Marx lived in London, writing articles and continuing his study of political economy.

51
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,620
Engels lived in Manchester working for the family business.

52
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:37,600
Ostensibly, he had given up his radical ways, but he, too, continued to research and

53
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:42,670
write. Marx and Engels maintained an almost daily correspondence where they further

54
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:45,190
discussed and elaborated the basic ideas.

55
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:48,340
They had come up with me 1840's and their work.

56
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:54,820
In the 1850s and 1860s and then into the 1870s was about fully developing and proving

57
00:03:54,820 --> 00:04:00,310
those ideas, ideas that coalesced into the philosophic, economic and political system

58
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:02,230
that is today known as Marxism.

59
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:06,820
Today we are going to talk through some of Marxism and it will almost certainly wind up

60
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:08,740
being an inadequate introduction.

61
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:10,570
But we have to start somewhere.

62
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:15,920
Now, since we are moving towards the Russian Revolution, I thought I might start by

63
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:20,630
borrowing an idea that Lenin promoted to frame our discussion of a few of the more

64
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:22,400
important Marxian ideas.

65
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:29,390
Lenin says that Marx, quote, was the genius who continued and consummated the three main

66
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:34,160
ideological currents of the 19th century, as represented by the three most advanced

67
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,420
countries of mankind.

68
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:41,360
Classical German philosophy, classical English, political economy and French socialism,

69
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:44,480
combined with French revolutionary doctrines in general.

70
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:50,630
And quote. So we might call these the three pillars of Marxism, German philosophy,

71
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:56,120
specifically the German philosophy operating in the aftermath of Hegel, English economics

72
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:00,640
and the classically liberal tradition, though really it's British economics because the

73
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:06,020
Scot Adam Smith looms so large, though Marx is most often grappling directly with David

74
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:12,110
Ricardo. And then finally, French utopian socialism Saltzman and focaccia who were dead

75
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:15,050
by the time Marx was encountering them in the early 1840s.

76
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:19,400
But also put on and Louis Baum, who were very much alive and working.

77
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:25,130
And the thing here is that Marx being Marx, he was not going to build his own philosophy

78
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:29,390
by simply taking what he had found and then continuing to build in the same direction as

79
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:33,290
his predecessors. Instead, he would challenge, critique and attack them.

80
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:36,140
They were the thesis. He was the antithesis.

81
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:38,390
Marxism was the synthesis.

82
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:45,560
So first we have the German philosophy component, which, as you know from last week was

83
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,730
Marx's first passion.

84
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:52,190
He was for sure aiming to become a professor of philosophy until the ideas he embraced

85
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:53,330
and the friends that he kept.

86
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:58,130
Made him toxic to the German universities, as we also talked about last week.

87
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:02,570
Young Marx, like every philosophy student in Germany at the time, was working in the

88
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:03,890
shadow of Hagel.

89
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:08,990
But specifically, Marx was working in one part of the shadow amongst the young Hegg

90
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:13,640
aliens who were rejecting many of the conclusions that had been reached by the great old

91
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:20,960
man. The biggest conclusion Hagel had reached that Marx thought wrong became the most

92
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,120
basic component of Marxist philosophy.

93
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:27,800
Hagel was an idealist and Marx was a materialist.

94
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:33,950
Idealism here does not refer to a belief in lofty morals and ideals, but rather the

95
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:38,510
philosophic position that what we encounter as existence is not actually a world of

96
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:40,190
things, but a world of ideas.

97
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:45,050
Everything comes down to ideas and the ideas we have about those ideas.

98
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:51,800
The material world, if such a thing even exists, is entirely secondary for an idealist

99
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:56,660
like Hagel. The mind and objects of the mind are the central subjects, not just a

100
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:58,940
philosophy, but of existence itself.

101
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:04,760
That what the thinking mind thinks is real life is really just a manifested projection of

102
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:07,130
some ideas held by the thinking mind.

103
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:13,010
But a branch of the young heart galleons started to turn this upside down to say, no,

104
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:17,930
wait a minute. The material world is really primary and all of our ideas about it are

105
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:22,280
secondary. They come as sense impressions or reflections on those sent impressions.

106
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:28,610
Even ideas themselves are the product of matter, acting upon matter in the neurochemistry

107
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:32,810
of the physical brain. It's all physical, it's all material substance.

108
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:38,120
They believed in this and travesty of the material world and marks from a very young age

109
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:43,160
was a confirmed materialist, and it became the great building block upon which he piled a

110
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,750
bunch of other building blocks.

111
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:50,900
But though he was starting from the opposite conclusion about the very nature of reality

112
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:56,180
by his own forthright acknowledgment, Marx drew very useful structures and tools and

113
00:07:56,180 --> 00:08:01,730
vocabulary from Hegel, even if ultimately Marx thought Hegel had everything stood on its

114
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:05,540
head. For example, we have dialectics.

115
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:10,850
You have probably encountered dialectics at some point, even if you don't know it.

116
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:16,250
It's an adversarial system of progressive reasoning that passes through three stages,

117
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:21,050
usually described as thesis, antithesis and synthesis.

118
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:24,860
It's the formula I use just a minute ago to foreshadow where we were headed.

119
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:27,590
First, a thesis is presented.

120
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:31,100
Then comes the antithesis that would seem to negate that thesis.

121
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,710
And then the tension is resolved by a conclusion.

122
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:38,030
The synthesis, which is the transcended union of the apparent opposites.

123
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:40,430
Keeping the good shaking loose the bad.

124
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:45,680
It's a dynamic form of construction, deconstruction and reconstruction.

125
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:49,280
Now, a few necessary caveats about this.

126
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:54,380
This dialectical form of reasoning and investigation goes way back to the beginning of

127
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:58,820
recorded history and enjoyed wide use in both ancient and medieval philosophy.

128
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:03,080
So dialectical reasoning is not some brand new thing that was invented by Hegel.

129
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:09,230
The second Hegel himself, nor Marx for that matter, really ever use the terms, thesis,

130
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,000
antithesis and synthesis.

131
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:13,010
That's just the way we conceive of it today.

132
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:17,660
And then finally, we must say that Hegel did not think dialectics needed to be

133
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:20,810
universally applied in rigidly dogmatic ways.

134
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:26,240
And in fact, he derided those who wanted to rely on mechanical formulas to answer every

135
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:32,450
problem. But still dialectical reasoning was imported from Hegel to Marx and from Marx

136
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:39,850
into Marxism. This re innovation and dialectical reasoning was exciting too early 19th

137
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:44,800
century German philosophers because it seemed unnecessary antidote to what had built up

138
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:48,190
during the Renaissance and the Enlightenment and the scientific revolution.

139
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:52,150
When philosophers started relying on different methods of investigation and

140
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:57,700
experimentation, these new methods isolated and examined individual variables to

141
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:00,880
understand all the different little bits that made things what they are.

142
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:04,080
They collected, separated and analyzed.

143
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:08,680
They arrange things into orders, classified them into complex schemes, and then took the

144
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:12,940
component parts of the component parts and further isolated and documented those.

145
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:16,210
Everything was put in a specimen jar and labeled.

146
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:21,400
This was done not just for things in the material world, but also for ideas and concepts.

147
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,830
They divided them up. Yes and no.

148
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:24,940
True and false.

149
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,410
Positive and negative cause and effect.

150
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:32,560
But they struggled because sometimes a thing is not just one thing at a time.

151
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:36,820
It was many different things and often apparently contradictory things.

152
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:38,500
Causes were effects.

153
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:39,850
Effects were causes.

154
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:44,770
They couldn't be stuck permanently in two separate specimen jars because they were

155
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:47,200
infused with the essence of many different things.

156
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:52,210
Then those who supported dialectical reasoning said these metaphysician is made the

157
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:56,890
further mistake of trying to get everything to stop moving so that properties and things

158
00:10:56,890 --> 00:11:01,900
and ideas could be described once and for all in their rigid, fixed and internal ways.

159
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,230
But nothing is ever rigid, fixed and eternal.

160
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:08,260
The universe and everything in it is in constant motion.

161
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:12,370
It's forever changing, evolving, interacting, appearing and passing away.

162
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:18,280
Grappling with a constantly changing, constantly in motion universe is not a problem for

163
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:22,810
dialectics, nor was it concerned about the myriad and troublesome contradictions.

164
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:25,630
In fact, it positively thrived on those contradictions.

165
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,460
Dialectic say yes.

166
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:31,570
Not only are these things opposite and contradictory, but their opposition brings them

167
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:37,330
into union. The apparent contradictions are needed to advance, develop, evolve and change

168
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:39,700
to take this simple and make it complex.

169
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:46,570
And so we as humans need to understand the dynamic, dialectical process of unfolding

170
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:51,580
transformative conflict between opposites as the path to understanding the true nature of

171
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:58,600
existence. Marks then took his materialism and these dialectics and combined them with

172
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:03,940
another of haggles, big ideas, and then really ran with it, that the confrontations and

173
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:08,710
conflict between apparently contradictory forces was the driver, not just a philosophical

174
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:10,840
advancement, but of human history.

175
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:16,410
So now we have the foundational concepts that allowed Marx to develop the core philosophy

176
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:22,020
that underlay all of his future research and political activism, dialectical materialism.

177
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:27,370
Shut out of the ivory tower and forced into the grubby world of being a political

178
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:28,630
journalist and activist.

179
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:34,090
Marx took his materialism and these dialectical patterns of reasoning and applied them to

180
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:36,790
the grubby world within which humans actually lived.

181
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:40,500
And in so doing, he started having epiphany after epiphany.

182
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:46,720
First, thanks to his understanding of flux and change, but and passing away, he advanced

183
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,860
beyond the materialism of guys like Newton, who were always trying to fix and pin down

184
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:53,140
immutable laws for eternal bodies.

185
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:58,480
Marx's materialism, on the other hand, embraced flux and growth and change.

186
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:00,220
Birth and death and evolution.

187
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:03,010
Going to spend a whole episode on this next week.

188
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:08,170
But Marx believed he had cracked the secret of history that the underlying economic

189
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:09,490
structure of society.

190
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:14,230
The means by which humans produce the necessities of life defined everything else.

191
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:18,820
And that you could not understand the world, and certainly not changed the world unless

192
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:24,400
you understood how the material economic substructure operated and how conflicts within

193
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,740
it were the fundamental drivers of history.

194
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:34,740
So armed with these concepts from German philosophy, when Marx arrived in Paris in 1843,

195
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:40,110
he was ready to start a thoroughgoing investigation of European political economy to

196
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:42,330
understand that economic substructure.

197
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:47,340
This is a project that would remain ongoing for the rest of his life until his death in

198
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:51,720
1883 when he was doing his work in political economy.

199
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:57,390
Marx was grappling with correcting and expanding the work of the classical liberal

200
00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:02,430
economists Adam Smith and Smith's disciple David Ricardo, as well as contemporaries like

201
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:03,510
John Stuart Mill.

202
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:08,640
And though in the modern popular imagination, Adam Smith and Karl Marx are considered

203
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:11,010
polar opposites, never the two shall meet.

204
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:15,210
But Marx, for one, did not think of himself as the enemy of Adam Smith.

205
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:20,790
And most of Marxian economics is working in the tradition of Smith and Ricardo, even if,

206
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:25,440
as in all things, Marx was aggressively critical of everyone who came before him.

207
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:32,400
So this transitions us from Marx, the philosopher to Marx, the economist from the German

208
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:37,350
philosophy pillar to the English economics pillar, as Marx attempted to understand the

209
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:39,730
material substructure of civilization.

210
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:46,380
And when you read Marx The Economist, you get hit with a lot of jargony concepts, most of

211
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:50,190
which sound indistinguishable from some of his other jargony concepts.

212
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:55,440
Mode of production factor of production means of production, means of labor, subject of

213
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:56,870
labor, instruments of labor.

214
00:14:57,570 --> 00:15:02,300
How is one to tell all of these things of production and things of labor apart?

215
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:08,640
Well, Marx himself is never 100 percent consistent in his usage of these terms, but they

216
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:12,960
can be arranged into what I like to call the Tree of Labors and productions.

217
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,570
And it's important to pick through this mostly.

218
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:21,060
So you have a clear idea of what Marx means by the umbrella concept mode of production,

219
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:25,650
which is very important to his historical materialism, and that's very important to the

220
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:32,700
Russian Revolution. So as the fit Marxian analysis, we will start at the bottom and move

221
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:37,710
our way to the top and we shall begin with the marriage of the instruments of labor and

222
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:43,200
the subjects of labor, the instruments of labor are just what you think they might be,

223
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:49,260
the tools of labor in the ordinary sense, hammers, lathes, needles, just the ordinary

224
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:52,050
tools that one might need to produce some product.

225
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:56,850
And in the larger sense, this also include infrastructure and factories.

226
00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:01,540
But those instruments are used on what correct?

227
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:06,910
They are used on the subject of labor, which you would consider the natural resources or

228
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:12,760
raw materials, wood, metals, textiles, the stuff a product is made out of.

229
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:18,010
And if you take the instruments of labor and you use them on the subjects of labor, you

230
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:20,650
can make a thing. You can produce a product.

231
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:27,120
And then if you take those two concepts, the instruments of labor plus the subjects of

232
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,750
labor and put them in a box together, you would label that box.

233
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:34,650
The means of production and spoiler alert.

234
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:39,990
Who owns the means of production is a very, very, very important question to answer.

235
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:46,420
But OK. The means of production is just a combination of the instruments of labor and the

236
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:50,610
subjects of labor. But it does not include the labor.

237
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:55,720
The means of production are inanimate and are not productive in and of themselves.

238
00:16:56,080 --> 00:17:00,430
You need animate energy provided by a human being to produce the product.

239
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:06,400
And when you combine those inanimate means of production with the animate human labor,

240
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:13,510
you get the concept of forces of production or productive forces or sometimes factors of

241
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:18,400
production. So again, this combined mix of the tools to do the work.

242
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:22,930
The raw materials, the work will be done on and the workers who will be doing the work

243
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:24,700
are the forces of production.

244
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:27,010
We can now really produce a product.

245
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:33,170
So far, so good. But this does not get us all the way to the top of the Tree of Labors

246
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:35,540
and productions to get to the top.

247
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:41,030
We need to combine those forces of production with something called the relations of

248
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:46,190
production, which can be described and I'm quoting here as the sum total of social

249
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:52,160
relations that people must enter into in order to survive, to produce and to reproduce

250
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:53,450
the means of their life.

251
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:58,820
Now, the relations up production are very important because they don't just include

252
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:03,740
things like the division of labor in a factory or how a corporation's org chart is drawn

253
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:09,380
up. It includes the totality of the social relations that swirl around the forces of

254
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:13,130
production. Some of these relations are entered into voluntarily.

255
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,920
Some of them are compelled and involuntary.

256
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:22,070
They involve hierarchical relations, political relations, family relations, social and

257
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,180
economic class.

258
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:27,240
Basically, all the myriad ways humans come to relate to one another.

259
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:29,360
To employ the forces of production.

260
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:33,950
To produce the means of their subsistence and then distribute it to the members of

261
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:39,890
society. No, Marx and Engels themselves mostly deployed this term in service to their

262
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:41,750
political and economic analysis.

263
00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:44,840
Who owned what specifically the means of production?

264
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,150
What the law said about who owned what?

265
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,380
Who controlled who?

266
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,960
Who was the boss? What were the social classes?

267
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:52,610
Where was their cooperation?

268
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:53,990
Where was their competition?

269
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:55,130
Where was their conflict?

270
00:18:55,670 --> 00:19:00,710
Their totality of all these relations of production constituted a society social

271
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:05,180
structure. And it was the part that determine how income and products and assets would be

272
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:09,920
distributed. And according to Marx, this was all ultimately rooted in servicing the

273
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,270
forces of production.

274
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:12,650
Whatever those happen to be.

275
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:17,840
But to take a step back for one minute, beyond the economic and political implications,

276
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:24,080
the analysis of the relations of production was a fairly profound and novel idea, and it

277
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:29,570
opened up vast exploratory possibilities and made Marx one of the founders of a whole new

278
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:32,300
field of social science called sociology.

279
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:38,560
But getting back to it, when you combine the relations up, production with the forces of

280
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:44,080
production, which remember are just the tools, material subjects and labor of a society's

281
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:49,510
economic production. We have basically a total description of how society organizes

282
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:54,010
itself to produce and distribute the means of its subsistence, which is, after all, the

283
00:19:54,010 --> 00:20:00,730
point of all this. Marx called this final concept the mode of production, and it's very

284
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:05,230
important because there have only been a few modes of production in human history and

285
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:07,390
we're gonna discuss that at length next week.

286
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:12,100
But there's the primitive mode, the ancient mode, the feudal mode and the capitalist

287
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:18,100
mode. The point of Marx's politics was to advance society from the prevailing capitalist

288
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:21,250
mode of production to a new socialist mode of production.

289
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:24,220
That is the great historical work to be done.

290
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:28,530
So how does Mark start coming around to that idea?

291
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:34,320
Well, as a young man, he really started taking stock of the world he was living in and he

292
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,780
felt that something was very wrong and off about it.

293
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:41,370
And this is where the third pillar of Marxism comes into the picture, because he started

294
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:46,500
being introduced to French socialism in studying revolutionary French ideas, because the

295
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:49,760
French socialists were also very critical of modern society.

296
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:54,300
And they had developed this social question and we're trying to provide answers for it.

297
00:20:55,170 --> 00:21:00,420
But given his dialectical materialism, Marx was none too impressed with the life of the

298
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:05,670
mind utopian socialists who were trying to established fixed and eternal laws of justice

299
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:09,390
and retreating to pure reason to solve all the world's problems.

300
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:14,220
When really what they needed to be doing is studying history, economics and politics.

301
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:18,930
How are you going to answer the social question if you don't understand the question?

302
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:24,980
So Marx took these three pillars, German philosophy and English economics and French

303
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:29,840
social theory and started to try to build his own answer to the social question.

304
00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:35,000
It was obvious that the capitalist mode of production had serious flaws that needed to be

305
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,490
addressed. But how to address them?

306
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,290
What even needed to be addressed?

307
00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:44,630
What made this new era of modern economics different from previous periods of history?

308
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:47,210
Now we're going to talk more about this next week.

309
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:52,850
But clearly, the profit motive as the central organizing principle of economic life was a

310
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:55,760
defining feature of the new capitalist mode of production.

311
00:21:56,540 --> 00:22:00,890
The idea that the point was not just to produce the necessities of life, but to produce

312
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:05,390
commodities that can be sold at a higher price than it took to produce them, and then

313
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:10,340
have this profit seeking commodity exchange not just confined to small local town

314
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:14,390
markets, but to envelop every aspect of social and economic life.

315
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:19,130
This led Marx to ask, well, where does profit even come from?

316
00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:25,850
And to answer this question, Marx developed the labor theory of value, which basically

317
00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:29,690
says that the root source of value and thus profit is labor.

318
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:35,360
Labor is the magical ingredient, which allows one to purchase a bunch of inanimate

319
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:40,550
instruments of labor and subjects of labor and then later sell the product that those

320
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:45,940
instruments of labor had turned the subjects of labor into for a higher price for a

321
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:52,700
profit. And Mark says even more specifically and emphatically that this is a process of

322
00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:59,870
exploitation. Basically, he sees things going like this, at least theoretically, the cost

323
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:05,030
of securing one day's labor from a worker must at least be equal to the costs necessary

324
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:07,400
to keep that worker alive for one day.

325
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:11,770
The food, drink and shelter and clothes, you gotta keep the worker alive.

326
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:16,340
But let's say you bring a bunch of laborers together to make some shoes.

327
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:21,410
And let's say that after four hours on the clock, the workers have used the instruments

328
00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:27,200
of labor on the subjects of labor to produce enough shoes that, when sold, will generate

329
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:31,910
the revenue necessary to supply the workers with the means of that daily subsistence.

330
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:37,190
This will come to them in the form of wages, but you're not going to blow the whistle and

331
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:38,780
call it a day after four hours.

332
00:23:39,410 --> 00:23:41,090
No, you're only at the break even point.

333
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:43,800
This is the capitalist mode of production and you want profit.

334
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:48,680
So you're gonna keep working them for another four hours, maybe another eight hours,

335
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:53,390
maybe since this is the 1860s and there are literally no regulations about this stuff.

336
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:58,580
Another 12 hours and all the shoes produced after those initial first four hours.

337
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:04,610
This is surplus labor creating surplus value and that is where profit comes from and the

338
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:07,010
profit goes to the capitalist owner.

339
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:12,590
Now, granted, that capitalist donor has lots of costs beyond just labor, but according to

340
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:17,300
the labor theory of value, the source of profit is the exploitation of surplus labor

341
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:21,110
paying less for the labor than the labor was ultimately worth.

342
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:26,600
And in Marx's estimation, this exploitation is terrible from a social and humanitarian

343
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:32,090
perspective. Now it gets really interesting because Marx has this further insight based

344
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:36,470
off of a reading of John Locke style theories of property that were so central to the

345
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:39,080
founding of modern liberal economic and political theory.

346
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:44,690
According to this theory, something becomes your property when you infuse it with your

347
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:49,940
labor, whether it is literally a craft that you made it some home workshop or a field

348
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:55,580
that you ploughed. If you worked on it, built it, improved it, shaped it, it became your

349
00:24:55,580 --> 00:25:00,770
property. This is how the abundance of things out in the state of nature can plausibly

350
00:25:00,890 --> 00:25:04,340
and morally and legally be recognized as personal property.

351
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:08,390
And to take just a recent example from the Revolutions podcast.

352
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:13,430
At the end of the Mexican Revolution, one of the ways land could be nationalized under

353
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:18,450
Article 27 of the New Mexican Constitution was if you weren't doing anything with it.

354
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:23,840
If it was just sitting there, quote unquote, unimproved or quote unquote unproductive.

355
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:26,990
This is Locky and theories of property at work.

356
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:30,970
You can't own something if it's just sitting there and you're not doing anything with it.

357
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:36,540
Well, what Mark saw in capitalism was a contradiction, a bastardization of this

358
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:42,570
principle, because under old modes of ancient and fuel production, the individual artisan

359
00:25:42,570 --> 00:25:43,860
would take raw materials.

360
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:49,050
The subject of labor used his tools, which are the instruments of labor, and apply his

361
00:25:49,050 --> 00:25:52,380
individual labor to take those raw materials to a finished product.

362
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:57,600
In this sense, it was his or her personal property, and not even a Marxist has a problem

363
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,070
with that kind of personal property.

364
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:04,290
The problem is that in capitalism, many people are being brought together.

365
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:09,420
They are doing individual little parts of the total and necessary labor, but not every

366
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:14,790
part. The division of labor inside a factory means that no one person can point to the

367
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:16,860
finished shoe and say That's mine.

368
00:26:16,890 --> 00:26:22,020
I made it. It is in every way the product of group effort, social labor.

369
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:26,490
And this includes not just the blue collar workers, but white collar employees in the

370
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:30,120
marketing department and sales department, accounting, human resources.

371
00:26:31,050 --> 00:26:33,420
But the profits don't come back to these workers.

372
00:26:33,810 --> 00:26:38,910
They are instead held by the owner who claim these profits as his or her individual

373
00:26:38,910 --> 00:26:39,990
property by. Right.

374
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:44,760
Not because he helped make the shoe or sell the shoe, but because he owned the means of

375
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:48,780
production. He owned the tools and the raw materials and the factory.

376
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:52,440
And thus anything that was produced by those tools and factories.

377
00:26:53,410 --> 00:26:58,570
So Mark Soor is the owner still claiming the right of Locky and ownership, even though

378
00:26:58,570 --> 00:27:02,050
the capitalist mode of production had really moved beyond the very thing that made

379
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:03,910
Lockean ownership comprehensible.

380
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:10,090
That individual labor created individual property, the capitalist system had replaced

381
00:27:10,090 --> 00:27:15,100
that individual labor with social labor, but the ownership in the property in the profit

382
00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:16,920
still remained individualized.

383
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:20,080
And this really chapped Marx's hide.

384
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,810
Now, is any of this true?

385
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,820
Is this really how it works?

386
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:30,470
Is this the final word on how value and profits are created in the marketplace?

387
00:27:30,890 --> 00:27:34,670
Did Marx have everything correct about the relation between labor and profit?

388
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:36,890
Is this really how the capitalist system works?

389
00:27:37,670 --> 00:27:39,290
The answer is kind of yes.

390
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:42,890
And kind of no. I am not an economist.

391
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:46,580
My habits and mindset are of course, focused on political history.

392
00:27:47,090 --> 00:27:51,890
But I know enough to know that a strict interpretation of the labor theory of value would

393
00:27:51,890 --> 00:27:56,620
not just be a controversial position to take, but probably an incorrect position to take

394
00:27:56,630 --> 00:27:58,610
because there's a lot more going on.

395
00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:04,160
Even those working inside a Marxist tradition who are sympathetic to Marxist theories and

396
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:09,290
want to salvage them as best they can have over the past hundred and fifty years, refined

397
00:28:09,290 --> 00:28:11,960
and updated his ideas, as you would expect.

398
00:28:12,410 --> 00:28:17,240
And as I expect Marx would expect, given that everyone now has one hundred and fifty more

399
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,650
years of data to work from.

400
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:23,010
But there is definitely still some element of truth to all this.

401
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:29,150
The point, though, is that politically, these are incredibly powerful ideas.

402
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:34,940
The pitch here is that you're fat capitalist owner is literally on purpose and by

403
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:40,400
necessity exploiting you, the worker that the capitalist makes you endure horrible

404
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:45,350
conditions while you provide all the essential labor, which is remember the only thing

405
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:50,600
that gives a commodity its value and thus creates profit and then cut you, the worker,

406
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:51,680
out of that profit.

407
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:54,740
The capitalist hoards it all for himself.

408
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:59,840
All you get is these piddly wages and even the notion of the necessary.

409
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:05,040
Over the stuff that precedes the surplus labor that is supposed to be keeping you alive,

410
00:29:05,630 --> 00:29:08,730
well, that amount that you get is squeezed and squeezed.

411
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:12,690
Just how little nourishment is enough to keep a human being alive.

412
00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:17,100
What counts as a shelter in the lived experience of the workers?

413
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:21,810
The plan always seemed to be drive down labor costs as low as humanly possible because

414
00:29:21,810 --> 00:29:26,550
when you add it all up, profit comes from the gap between how low your labor costs are

415
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,870
and how high a price you can charge for the commodity that labor produces.

416
00:29:31,530 --> 00:29:36,360
And the idea is, if you explain it to the workers in just this way, that they will rise

417
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:37,560
up in revolution.

418
00:29:39,370 --> 00:29:44,260
Now, according to angles, this theory of surplus value and the exploitation of the worker

419
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:47,920
was one of the two most important discoveries made by his friend Karl Marx.

420
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:53,530
It's what made his system superior to the French socialist and the utopians who did not

421
00:29:53,530 --> 00:29:55,720
understand the realities of economic life.

422
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,420
They did not understand the nature of economics.

423
00:29:58,630 --> 00:29:59,860
The factors of production.

424
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:01,210
The relations of production.

425
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,090
And so they would never understand how to change things.

426
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:07,540
This is what set the scientific socialism of Marx.

427
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:14,770
Apart from the mere utopian socialism of his predecessors, we will spend next week on the

428
00:30:14,770 --> 00:30:16,060
other great discovery.

429
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:18,430
Historical materialism.

430
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:25,600
This is what makes Marx's work not just a guide to understanding the world, but a roadmap

431
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,450
for how to change it.
