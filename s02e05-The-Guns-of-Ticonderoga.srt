00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:07,360
Hello and welcome to Revolutions.

2
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:15,530
Episode 21, The Guns of Ticonderoga.

3
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:23,850
So we left off last time with Britain and
her American colonies, more or less on the brink

4
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:28,650
of war and indeed over the winner of
seventeen seventy four, seventy five, there were

5
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:31,200
multiple opportunities for the
war to break out.

6
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:36,030
But being civilized 18th century gentleman, everyone
decided it was best to wait for

7
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:41,490
spring to really get down to business, the
various opportunities for the war to break out

8
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:43,410
and indeed the one that
finally did the trick.

9
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:48,690
We're all related to General Thomas Gages attempt to
bring all the guns and powder in New

10
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:54,000
England. Under his control town, militias would
often store their guns and ammunition in

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,080
collective caches.

12
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:59,670
And the winter of seventeen seventy four seventy
five was basically a race to see who

13
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:04,170
could withdraw the powder from those caches
first without provoking the other side to

14
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:10,350
start shooting. So prior to Lexington and Concord,
there were three big incidents of this

15
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:14,970
type, the first known as the powder
alarm, occurred on September the 1st.

16
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:16,140
Seventeen seventy four.

17
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:20,820
So this is actually just before the
first Continental Congress met, the British regulars

18
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:25,290
were able to secretly and peacefully secure what
was left in the Powder House northwest

19
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:27,270
of Boston the next day.

20
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:31,980
Thousands of militiamen turned out fueled on by
exaggerated rumors that the war was on.

21
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:34,920
But when the rumors didn't
pan out, they all dispersed.

22
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:40,920
The second incident, known as the
Portsmouth Alarm, involved the colonial militiamen

23
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:46,290
actively seizing the cache at Fort William and
Mary in mid-December with shots fired in

24
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:50,040
the process, arguably the first shots
fired in the Revolutionary War.

25
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,970
Finally, we have the Salem
alarm in February 17.

26
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:58,350
Seventy five, which ended when the British regiment
sent to lock up the sale and powder

27
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:02,430
ran into a wall of militia that
forced them to turn back empty handed.

28
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:07,530
Like I say, any one of these could have
turned ugly enough to have really marked the

29
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:11,550
beginning of the war. But in the
end, the peace held until April 17.

30
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:15,090
Seventy five when the conquered powder
was next on the list.

31
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:23,660
Which brings us to Lexington, Concord and the shot
heard round the world, which I am not

32
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:24,980
going to talk about right now.

33
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:30,200
As some of you know, in the interim, between
the end of the history of Rome and the

34
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:35,120
beginning of revolutions, I was in grad
school where I took a documentary filmmaking

35
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:41,120
class, the final project for which wound up
being a video about Lexington, Concord and

36
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,270
the shot heard round the world.

37
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:48,650
So in lieu of talking about it here,
I have embedded that video at Revolutions podcast,

38
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:53,270
Dotcom. But before you watch it, here
is what you need to know.

39
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:59,990
First, the video functions as a pilot episode
for a proposed series called Legend Has It

40
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:03,060
that compares historical myth
to historical reality.

41
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:05,030
So that's the thematic framework.

42
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,170
Second, it is in every way a student film.

43
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:13,430
The production values are low, particularly
when it comes to the audio.

44
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:19,580
Third, there are a few little flubs along the
way, like when at one point I accidentally

45
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:23,060
refer to Longfellow as Wadsworth Fourth.

46
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:27,680
As the sleep deprivation mounted,
the tone became increasingly silly.

47
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:32,300
And there will be, I'm sure, things that either
come too fast to be caught or just make

48
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:36,860
no sense at all. It will, for example,
help if you've seen the old nineteen seventies

49
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:42,150
Incredible Hulk series, and I'm not kidding
about that fifth, I think that's it.

50
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:44,980
So enjoy. That's all in good fun.

51
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:49,400
So let's say we don't take too critical a
sledgehammer to it, but that's where you need

52
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:54,890
to go. For all of the endlessly fascinating
details about Lexington, Concord and the shot

53
00:03:54,890 --> 00:04:00,690
heard round the world. For our purposes right now,
though, what you need to know is that

54
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:05,070
the quote unquote battles at Lexington and
Concord marked the beginning of the American

55
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:08,930
Revolutionary War or if you prefer,
the American War of independence.

56
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,700
Now, these skirmishes were easily packaged
by colonial leaders as purely defensive

57
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:19,260
engagement, which was important to keep moderate
patriots from falling into the loyalist

58
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:25,080
camp. But unfortunately for those concerned with
such optics, the initiative taken by a

59
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:30,090
couple of hundred zealous militia men in upstate
New York could enjoy no such packaging.

60
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:36,240
I am talking here about Ethan Allen, Benedict
Arnold and the capture of Fort Ticonderoga.

61
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:42,780
Fort Ticonderoga had been built on the southwest
side of Lake Champlain by the French and

62
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:47,610
seventeen fifty five, but it was seized by
the British a few years later by seventeen

63
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:51,960
seventy five. The fort was in a
sorry state garrison by two officers.

64
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:54,870
Forty eight soldiers and
some dilapidated walls.

65
00:04:55,830 --> 00:05:02,070
Early in May, the hulking, boisterous but
surprisingly intellectual Ethan Allen got it

66
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:05,970
into his head to make a play at the fort
as it lay on the most direct route for a

67
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:11,460
possible British invasion from Canada, or, conversely,
might serve as a useful staging

68
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:14,460
ground for any invasion by
the Americans into Canada.

69
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:20,010
Ethan Allen was originally from Connecticut, but
in the years before the revolution, he

70
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:24,480
had made a name for himself as the
leader of independent minded settlers in the New

71
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:25,520
Hampshire grant.

72
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:27,390
What is today in the state of Vermont?

73
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:32,910
New York claimed the territory, but the
settlers refused to recognize their authority.

74
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:38,820
Colonel Allen, as he was then popularly known,
actually carried a price on his head by

75
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:43,410
the government of New York for his work
leading the Green Mountain Boys, a well-organized

76
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:47,850
militia focused almost exclusively on convincing New
York that it wasn't worth the

77
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:49,290
trouble to try and govern them.

78
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:53,940
So when the fighting broke out down
in Massachusetts, the Green Mountain boys, though

79
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:58,080
small, were one of the most experienced
and disciplined of the colonial militias.

80
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:01,530
And Allen aimed to turn their
skills now against the British.

81
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:08,300
But Ethan Allen was not the only one who
had his eye on Ticonderoga, the other man who

82
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:13,490
was at that same moment itching to take
the fort was the now infamous Benedict Arnold.

83
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:19,560
Also originally from Connecticut, the 34 year
old Arnold came from wealthy Rhode Island

84
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:25,230
stock. He was athletic, charming and pretty
uniformly successful at whatever he put his

85
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:30,210
mind to. He was an early
and active supporter of colonial resistance.

86
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:34,470
And when the storm clouds really started
brewing, he was elected to the Connecticut

87
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:40,350
militia. In March 1775, after Lexington
and Concord, he approached the Massachusetts

88
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:44,970
Committee of Safety, which had been set up
as a sort of patriot shadow government and

89
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:49,950
asked for a commission to go organize
and capture Ticonderoga, a commission he was

90
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:55,710
granted. Arnold then struck north, and on May
the 10th he came across Ethan Allen and

91
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:59,610
Allen's two hundred odd troops
promptly declared himself in command.

92
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:05,040
Allen, of course, scoffed at this, but luckily
both men wanted the same thing and wanted

93
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,450
it as soon as possible.

94
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:09,300
So they agreed to
immediately attack the fort.

95
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:14,130
Now there is no such thing
as a Battle of Ticonderoga.

96
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:19,290
The garrison was literally surprised in their beds
and outnumbered four to one put up no

97
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:24,930
resistance. The garrison commander quickly negotiated
the surrender and safe passage for

98
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:27,930
his men and the twenty four
women and children living with them.

99
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:34,440
So without firing a shot, the fort was
secure, though its strategic value was never quite

100
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,460
what it might have been.

101
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:40,770
The capture of Ticonderoga was absolutely critical to
the early days of the war for one

102
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:42,090
very important reason.

103
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:48,270
When Allen and Arnold took stock, they
discovered that Ticonderoga held a fairly enormous

104
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:54,510
cache of artillery, including small four pound
guns, mortars, howitzers and huge twenty

105
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:58,080
four pound guns, plus ammunition
for all of it.

106
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:03,940
As we are about to see, these are the
guns that Washington will use to fortify Dorchester

107
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,450
and drive the British out of Boston.

108
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:12,850
Coincidentally enough, May the 10th also happened
to be the day that the Second

109
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:15,340
Continental Congress convened
in Philadelphia.

110
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:22,000
Now, as you will recall, the first Congress had
disbanded back in October, 1774, set on a

111
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,440
plan of economic resistance.

112
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:28,690
The second Congress was probably planned to do
nothing more than check back in and get

113
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:32,500
geared up for the non exportation phase of
the plan that would begin in September.

114
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:36,570
But of course, fate had now
dealt them a very different hand.

115
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:42,100
Many of the delegates at the second Congress
were holdovers from the first, but there

116
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:47,470
were now a few new faces, including
John Hancock, the recently returned to America,

117
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:52,450
Benjamin Franklin and before too long,
the young Virginia intellectual Thomas Jefferson.

118
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:58,090
This second, Congress had to deal first and
foremost with the question of how to respond

119
00:08:58,090 --> 00:08:59,470
to the fighting in Massachusetts.

120
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:04,240
It was almost universally agreed that they should
help organize an armed defense of the

121
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,660
colonies. But to what end was now?

122
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:14,080
The great question is this merely to secure
a just reconciliation or are we embarked on

123
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,300
the road to independence?

124
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:21,460
This, for example, is where John Dickinson
morphs from radical to conservative, not

125
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:26,320
because he changed, but because the times changed
and he is about to become the leading

126
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,510
opponent of American independence.

127
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:34,960
The Congress spent the first few weeks of
its life debating what it meant by armed

128
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:39,910
defense, are we simply going to coordinate action by
the militias or are we going to form

129
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:42,880
an independent, let's call
it a continental army?

130
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:48,070
In the midst of this news from Ticonderoga
arrived, which made it harder to argue that

131
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:52,480
the colonies were just defending themselves
and helped introduce some friction as

132
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:56,650
Ticonderoga was in New York and no one from
New York had even been told about the

133
00:09:56,650 --> 00:10:02,470
operation. That was, oh, by the way, led by a
man they were trying to throw in jail, but

134
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:03,660
they all mostly got over it.

135
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:08,080
And by the end of May, a consensus was
forming around the idea of creating and supplying

136
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:13,630
an independent continental army to first augment
and then hopefully supersede the local

137
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:19,660
militias. There were a few men present who
had their eye on commanding this new army,

138
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,550
most famously John Hancock.

139
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:25,600
But there wasn't really any question
who the commission would go to.

140
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:31,570
Absolutely had to be George Washington, who
knew enough about the role Providence had

141
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:37,120
ordained for him to show up at the
first session of Congress in full military uniform.

142
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:46,470
OK, so George Washington, George Washington was
born in Virginia in February 17, thirty

143
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:52,380
two into a gentry family of the middle tier
doing well, but not in that upper crust of

144
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:54,280
the Virginia planter aristocracy.

145
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:59,010
His father died when he was a teenager, so
it fell to his older brother, Lawrence, to

146
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:00,760
become his main guiding influence.

147
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:06,210
It was Lawrence's connection to the
enormously powerful Fairfax family that got

148
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:09,900
Washington his first job as a county
surveyor at the age of 17.

149
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:15,150
I must, of course, mention that, yes, this is
the same Fairfax family as our old friend,

150
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:19,620
Sir Thomas Fairfax, whose title had passed to
a cousin after his death in sixteen seventy

151
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:24,390
one. And then it was handed down to the
line to the sixth Earl of Fairfax, who pretty

152
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:26,820
much owned more land in Virginia than anyone.

153
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:33,240
This same Fairfax clan will also provide young
George with his first love, Sally Fairfax.

154
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:36,480
So connections between
our revolutions abound.

155
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:43,680
Anyway, when Lawrence died in 1752, George inherited
his estate, including a spot on the

156
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,540
Potomac called Mount Vernon.

157
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:51,580
Young George soon developed a passion for the
two things that would come to dominate his

158
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:58,240
life land speculation and military service, he finagled
a commission as a major in the

159
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:03,310
Virginia militia. And as tensions with France mounted,
he wound up being the guy assigned

160
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:08,560
to head a small expedition in 1753 into the
Ohio Valley to politely tell the French to

161
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:12,820
get the hell out. The next year, he
was ordered back into the valley with vague

162
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:17,350
instructions to defend the frontier, and he
wound up encountering and getting whipped

163
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:22,600
pretty badly by a mix of French and
Indians, the small but thoroughly, let's call it

164
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:25,270
instructive battle of Fort Necessity.

165
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:30,430
When the French and Indian War finally broke
out, Washington was present at but managed

166
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:35,560
to survive Braddock's disastrous march in 1755,
despite the bullets flying every which

167
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:39,370
way, a lucky habit Washington
would enjoy his entire life.

168
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:46,110
Tales of his various adventures, though they
were not all that successful, circulated

169
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:50,220
through the colonies and Washington became the
closest thing America had to a military

170
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:55,470
hero. This earned him a commission as a
colonel, though critically, this was all still

171
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:58,550
within the ranks of the
militia, not the regular army.

172
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:02,250
And it was around this point that he
really started to chafe under the presumed

173
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:07,380
superiority of regular officers, like when, for
example, some captain tried to give him

174
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:12,630
orders. He spent the rest of the war
leading a thousand militiamen defending the Virginia

175
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:18,510
frontier, a period during which he developed
his rather intent loathing of militiamen who

176
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:24,780
he would forever consider unreliable,
undisciplined, insubordinate and cowardly because

177
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:28,560
he spent as much time tracking down
deserters as he did fighting the French.

178
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:35,980
After the war, the Washington Mary, the
enormously wealthy widow, Martha Costus, which is

179
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:40,270
how he pole vaulted from the middling rank to
one of the richest men in the American

180
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:44,560
colonies and how he became the owner
of well over two hundred slaves.

181
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:49,870
As the prerevolutionary pressure built in Washington
was focused mainly on running his

182
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:53,860
estates, acquiring new property and
keeping his creditors at bay.

183
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:57,110
Because, like all good Virginia planters,
he ran on borrowed money.

184
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:03,190
He also took up his place in the
Virginia House of Burgesses and long dissatisfied with

185
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:06,110
British arrogance, both
militarily and economically.

186
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:09,490
He soon fell in with
the more radically inclined leaders.

187
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:14,020
And as you'll recall, he was a prime
mover behind the non importation response to the

188
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:18,400
Townsend acts as the crisis
reached its boiling point.

189
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:23,800
He was appalled by the intolerable acts, was
a delegate to the first Continental Congress

190
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:28,330
and is now a delegate to the Second
Continental Congress, though he will soon be leaving

191
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:33,580
for Boston as the Congress duly bestowed upon
America's most famous soldier the title of

192
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:36,520
commander in chief of all colonial forces.

193
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:44,610
In the meantime, the so-called triumvirate of
reputation had already arrived in Boston.

194
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:48,740
The three men who will wind up
leading the British campaigns during the Revolutionary

195
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:55,310
War, generals William Henry Clinton and John Burgoyne,
who we will deal with in turn as

196
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:56,930
they each move to center stage.

197
00:14:57,890 --> 00:15:00,710
For the moment, however, General Thomas
Gage is still in charge.

198
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:06,170
And after Lexington and Concord, Gaige, in
consultation with his new military advisers,

199
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:10,970
had studied the options and by the end
of May determined they would fortify the heights

200
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:14,330
around Boston and plan to
begin in earnest in mid-June.

201
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:20,000
But word soon leaked to the Committee of
Safety, and they ordered Artemus Ward, farmer and

202
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,780
veteran of the French and Indian War and
the man now leading the combined New England

203
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:29,300
militia stationed in Cambridge to go occupy
Bunker Hill and Dorchester Heights, which

204
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:31,740
command of the north and
south of Boston, respectively.

205
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:37,850
There is a map of colonial Boston posted
at Revolutions podcast Dotcom, so you can follow

206
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:43,700
along at home, not Dorchester Heights will
remain for the moment off the board.

207
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:49,040
But on June 16th, Ward ordered William Prescott
to take just over a thousand men from

208
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:53,960
Cambridge over to occupy Bunker Hill, which, if you
don't have the map in front of you,

209
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:59,300
was located on a peninsula that hangs out
over Boston that also contains the now empty

210
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:00,590
city of Charlestown.

211
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:04,790
The men weren't ready to go until nine p.m.

212
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:10,470
And so this all winds up being a night
operation when they got out to the peninsula.

213
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:13,550
Prescott decided to fortify
Breed's Hill instead.

214
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:17,700
It was slightly lower, but better
situated to repel a British advance.

215
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:22,820
The men spent all night digging, and when Dawn
broke, they had a pretty nice redoubt in

216
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:27,230
place. When the British Navy caught sight
of the rebel fortifications the next morning,

217
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:31,390
they opened fire. But the angle was
all wrong and they did minimal damage.

218
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:37,610
That said, by noon on June the 17th,
the militiamen were exhausted and discouraged that

219
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:38,930
they had not been relieved yet.

220
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:43,820
And despite their good work on Breed's
Hill, all likely flanking routes were still

221
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:45,230
perilously unguarded.

222
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:48,110
And Prescott begged Ward to send more men.

223
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:54,410
Meanwhile, General Gage, awoken by the Navy
blasts, selected the east side of the

224
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:57,890
peninsula as the best place to land,
which was all well and good.

225
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,140
Except that meant waiting for the tide.

226
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:05,210
And the fifteen hundred regulars led by William
Howe, didn't put to shore until around

227
00:17:05,210 --> 00:17:11,030
one o'clock. More shelling of the rebels
followed, as did further reinforcements for both

228
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:17,930
sides. How then divided his troops, now
numbering over 2000 into three columns designed

229
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:23,090
to envelop the defences on Breed's Hill, with
the left serving as a diversion to allow

230
00:17:23,090 --> 00:17:25,490
the main flanking move to
come over from the right.

231
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:30,590
But unfortunately for the British, not only was
the ground more difficult than they were

232
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:35,480
prepared for, but the two hundred militiamen
guarding the hastily fortified fence line,

233
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:40,190
guarding the right, waited until the approaching
regulars were just 50 yards away and

234
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:44,360
then started blasting, killing at least
a hundred pretty much instantly.

235
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,490
And the British were forced to fall back.

236
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:52,220
And this would be where I mention the most
famous order given in the battle of the

237
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:56,990
militiamen, not fire until you can see the
whites of their eyes to protect their limited

238
00:17:56,990 --> 00:18:01,760
ammunition. But this order has been
variously attributed to different officers at

239
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:05,340
different points in the battle and was
probably never even set at all.

240
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:12,470
So they're. A second attempt soon followed,
again, aiming simultaneously at the fence line

241
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:16,940
and the redoubt, but again, the approaching
regulars marching smartly were wide open

242
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:21,770
targets for the colonials as how elected not to
go by the book and attack in a narrow

243
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:26,390
column because this is not supposed
to be that hard anyway.

244
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:31,310
The second attempt also failed, but by now,
Prescott and his men were basically out of

245
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:35,990
ammunition. So a half an hour
later, reinforced by another 400 men.

246
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:37,760
How ordered the 3rd assault?

247
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,230
No more messing around.

248
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:41,730
Just a strong push right up Breed's Hill.

249
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:46,880
It was a grisly business, but it did
the trick, especially since the Americans were now

250
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,290
officially out of ammunition.

251
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:53,900
The regulars poured into the redoubt and the
militiamen scrambled back to Bunker Hill to

252
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:56,720
regroup as the redoubt was taken.

253
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:00,320
The revolution gets its first
martyred war hero as Dr.

254
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:05,000
Joseph Warren, author of The Suffolk Resolves and
serving as a common soldier because his

255
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,600
officers commission hadn't come through
yet, was shot and killed.

256
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:14,570
Unfortunately, again, for the British, the taking
of the redoubt had broken up their

257
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:18,650
ranks, and by the time they were organized
enough to press on, the remaining militiamen

258
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:23,390
had elected to withdraw from the peninsula
altogether, which meant that the British won

259
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:27,500
the battle always and forever, erroneously
called the battle of Bunker Hill.

260
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:31,560
But the body count soon told a somber story.

261
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:35,810
Two hundred regulars killed
with another 800 wounded.

262
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:41,690
Henry Clinton noted wryly in his diary that
a few more such victories would have surely

263
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:44,300
put an end to British Dominion in America.

264
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:51,110
After the battle, the two sides settled back
into their respective positions a few weeks

265
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:52,850
later, July the 2nd, to be exact.

266
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:57,110
Washington arrived to take on overall command
of the army, which now numbered about

267
00:19:57,110 --> 00:20:00,890
16000, though only about fourteen
thousand were fit for duty.

268
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:05,990
The British, meanwhile, now have at the moment
about six thousand in Boston, a number

269
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:09,760
that could grow to nine
thousand by early 1776.

270
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,890
But although the colonial turnout was pretty
good, it was also composed entirely of

271
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:19,180
Washington's arch enemy, the
local militia company.

272
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,830
These guys were just generally
disrespectful of normal army life.

273
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:27,140
They came and went as they please,
and they elected their own officers.

274
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:29,000
So good luck keeping anyone in line.

275
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:34,340
The irony, of course, is that these guys
pretty much embodied the kind of freedom and

276
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:36,230
liberty the war was supposed to be about.

277
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:39,140
And Washington had no time or
patience for any of it.

278
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:43,520
He started issuing all kinds of orders
against things like drinking and gambling and

279
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:48,590
swearing. And any officer or enlisted man who
failed to live up to his standards was

280
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:53,390
simply summarily dismissed as he
beat this army into shape.

281
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:56,610
I mean, literally beat slashings
were an everyday occurrence.

282
00:20:57,260 --> 00:21:01,880
Washington also strengthen the fortifications around
Boston, which were at that point

283
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:08,510
frankly embarrassing as Washington got to work up
a New England led Congress down in

284
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:13,730
Philadelphia, continued work on building a
justification for their actions, though they

285
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:17,960
sent out somewhat mixed messages despite the fact
that they were drafted by the same two

286
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:21,830
men, John Dickinson and the
newly arrived Thomas Jefferson.

287
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:28,300
Passed it almost the same time we have on
the one hand, the olive branch petition, a last

288
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:32,260
attempt at peacefully negotiating away the
economic underpinnings of the conflict.

289
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:37,840
And on the other, we have the declaration of
the causes and necessity of taking up arms,

290
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:40,000
which is hopefully pretty self-explanatory.

291
00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:46,000
In the former, Jefferson's draft was softened by
Dickinson, who still clung to the dream

292
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:51,250
of reconciliation, while in the latter,
Dickinson actually made Jefferson's draft blunter

293
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:56,440
and more direct because he may have been worried
he was about to lose all influence if he

294
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,990
didn't do something to prove that his
heart was still in this thing.

295
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:03,880
And he did technically believe that the
colonists were right to defend themselves, just

296
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,940
not the independent was the aim.

297
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:10,630
But whatever hope of
negotiated reconciliation still lingered.

298
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:16,000
Died when King George refused to even
receive the olive branch petition and parliament

299
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,490
officially declared the
colonies in rebellion.

300
00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:25,560
Back up in Boston by now, both sides were
well dug in and both firmly under the command

301
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:30,810
of their new respective leaders, General Washington
for the Americans and William Howard

302
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:35,610
for the British, who took over from the
now thoroughly discredited General Gage in late

303
00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:37,410
September 1775.

304
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:41,460
Now, William Howe is
a pretty interesting dude.

305
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:45,660
He was one of three brothers, all
of whom had distinguished military careers.

306
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:50,490
And indeed, his older brother is Admiral Richard
Howe, who will serve as the supreme

307
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:52,010
naval commander during the war.

308
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:56,250
So really, for the next couple of years, the
British war effort is in the hands of the

309
00:22:56,250 --> 00:23:02,430
Howe brothers and the Howe brothers were wait
for it entirely sympathetic to the American

310
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:07,920
colonies. They were pretty staunch Whigs who
opposed most of the ministry's policies in

311
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:11,440
America and really super
oppose the intolerable acts.

312
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:16,890
In fact, Admiral Richard Howe had initiated
last minute back channel dealings with

313
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:19,470
Benjamin Franklin to try to avert war.

314
00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:24,920
But when war came, neither could refuse
the service they had been called to.

315
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:29,280
And so when William Howe took over for
Gaige, his aim was to win the war.

316
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:34,830
But as we will see, there will be more
than a few missed opportunities along the way,

317
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:40,140
which some have attributed to House preference
for comfortable in action, some to his

318
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:43,530
unwillingness to waste troops, especially after
what he saw at Bunker Hill.

319
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:48,870
But what I sometimes suspect is that there was a
desire and how not just to win the war,

320
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:52,710
but also the peace that would
follow the inevitable British victory.

321
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:58,230
And waging two brutal war would unjustly punish
the colonists for defending a cause that

322
00:23:58,230 --> 00:24:01,140
Howe himself was entirely sympathetic to.

323
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:08,410
As the autumn of seventeen seventy five set
in, everyone was still staring at each other

324
00:24:08,410 --> 00:24:13,360
and occasionally chatting with each other across
the lines, but by now, Washington faced

325
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:16,490
the great problem that would plague
him for the entire war.

326
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:21,370
All those militia enlistments that were due
to expire on January the 1st.

327
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,270
And none of those guys had even
hinted that they planned to stick around.

328
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:29,230
The general feeling being that we've done our
bit, now it's time for somebody else to

329
00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:34,390
take over. So as he's trying to hold the
siege together, Washington is also about to have

330
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:39,430
to completely swap out his army and, of
course, lose whatever training may have sunk in

331
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:40,720
with all those lashings.

332
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:47,040
As the commander in chief stared down this
problem, one of his new subordinates was

333
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:51,570
staring down a problem of his own, one that
would be just as critical to winning Boston

334
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:53,880
as the problem of
refilling the American ranks.

335
00:24:55,450 --> 00:25:02,380
And November 17, seventy five, Washington sent
the let's call him plump Henry Knox,

336
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:07,780
twenty five year old bookseller, but now
self-taught artillery expert up to Fort

337
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:13,090
Ticonderoga to figure out how to move the
guns to Boston, a problem made nearly

338
00:25:13,090 --> 00:25:17,290
unsolvable because of the fact that there
were no roads linking the two.

339
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:23,830
But on December the 5th, Knox set off
into the snowy wilderness with forty four guns,

340
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:30,100
both light and heavy, 14 mortars, one howitzer
and all the ammunition to run them,

341
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:32,910
totaling some 60 tons of material.

342
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:37,480
It has gone down in history
as the noble train of artillery.

343
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:43,360
And over the next ten weeks, Knox's men used
first barges and then oxen pulled sleds to

344
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,650
literally drag the guns.

345
00:25:44,650 --> 00:25:48,620
S finally arriving in the American
camp on January the 27th.

346
00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:51,520
It was a bona fide miracle.

347
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:58,940
In the meantime, Washington was busy reforming his
army spirits were still pretty high at

348
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:05,120
this point, and the militias had managed to
recruit and or retain 7000 men, while the

349
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:10,340
first batch of official continental soldiers showed
up totaling some 9000 men, which was

350
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:13,060
good, though it fell well
short of the target.

351
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:19,730
Twenty thousand. Washington was utterly sick to death
of the siege at this point and soon

352
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:22,600
proposed an audacious attack
on the unsuspecting British.

353
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:27,950
But his war council talked him down
and suggested instead tightening the noose by

354
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:33,080
fortifying Dorchester Heights with the
recently arrived guns because inexplicably,

355
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:36,410
neither side yet controlled this
all important high ground.

356
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:40,790
But trying to occupy the heights
was not without its own risks.

357
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:46,070
The job would have to be done silently and
all in one night, or the Americans would be

358
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:47,830
wide open for an attack by the British.

359
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:51,970
Not only that, but the ground
was too frozen to dig into.

360
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:55,040
So how would they even defend
themselves once they got there?

361
00:26:56,260 --> 00:27:00,490
After working through the logistics of the
thing, Washington and his officers finally

362
00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:03,870
determined that, yes, it was doable and yes,
they were going to go for it.

363
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:10,780
On the night of March the 2nd, 1776, they
let fly a short bombardment to give the British

364
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:15,040
something to think about. The next night,
both sides started shelling each other.

365
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:20,860
And the night after that March the 4th,
the shelling went into overdrive, just as

366
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:25,740
Washington hoped, because as this artillery
skirmish was playing out, twelve hundred

367
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:29,970
workmen and eight hundred infantrymen hurried up
the heights and got to work.

368
00:27:30,610 --> 00:27:35,800
Now, they had already constructed above
ground fortifications and worked furiously but

369
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:40,570
silently through the night, successfully constructing
two redoubts and mounting the

370
00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:44,290
biggest guns before dawn, according
to the old legend.

371
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:48,820
When how woke up the next morning, he was
amazed and said, My God, these fellows have

372
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:52,300
done more in one night than I could
make my army do in three months.

373
00:27:52,930 --> 00:27:54,610
And it's doubtful that he actually said it.

374
00:27:55,030 --> 00:27:56,560
But the sentiment feels about right.

375
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:02,940
With the American artillery looming over them,
the British position in Boston became

376
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:09,030
untenable, but in the end, this was all
possibly more embarrassing and annoying to now

377
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:11,360
than it was a devastating strategic blow.

378
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:15,870
And many historians suspect that he
had already decided to evacuate Boston.

379
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:20,580
So what the fortification of Dorchester Heights really
meant was that he could no longer

380
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:21,970
leave on his own terms.

381
00:28:22,610 --> 00:28:27,060
Indeed, how now concluded that he couldn't leave
without a fight and he planned a full

382
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:29,550
scale assault of the American
position on the right.

383
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:33,480
But a debilitating blizzard cancelled the
operation at the last minute.

384
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:35,200
And how took the hint.

385
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:40,260
On March 17th, all the British troops were
out of Boston and loaded on to their

386
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:42,870
transport, where they sailed
away for Halifax.

387
00:28:43,530 --> 00:28:48,960
Washington led a triumphal procession into the
city to wild jubilation in the streets.

388
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:55,420
So all things considered, it had been a
pretty great year for the American patriots, they

389
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:59,770
had proven their resolve at Lexington and
Concord, proving their courage at Bunker Hill

390
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:02,580
and now force the British
out of Boston completely.

391
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:11,050
But of course, 1776 will not prove nearly
so glorious, nor was 1775 so uniformly

392
00:29:11,050 --> 00:29:16,830
successful. So next week, we will backtrack a
little and cover the debacle that was the

393
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:22,920
invasion of Canada and then head into the
auspicious year of 1776, which will see the

394
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:27,930
colonies boldly declare independence and then
get trounced repeatedly in the field,

395
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:32,790
making some doubt whether they could
back up their lofty rhetoric.
