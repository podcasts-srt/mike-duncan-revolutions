00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:13,960
Hello, and welcome to revolutions Episode 28 Yorktown.

2
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:22,210
Today we come to the end of the American War of Independence.

3
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:28,120
What had started in the 1760s as a political conflict over the place of the American colonies within

4
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:33,370
the British Empire, it turned into a military conflict that was now dragging into its sixth year.

5
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:38,590
During these years, the leaders of the American Revolution had been consumed almost entirely with the

6
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:43,960
task of running the war. But the victory Yorktown finally allowed them to return to the questions that

7
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:48,550
had roused them to action in the first place. What are the proper limits of government? What are the

8
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:54,130
rights of the citizens? How do we reconcile the forces of power and liberty so that we can preserve

9
00:00:54,130 --> 00:01:00,490
freedom while maintaining stability? While the war was on these questions were mostly tabled in the interest

10
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:06,789
of maintaining a united Patriotic Front. When the war ended, it came time to figure out what it had

11
00:01:06,789 --> 00:01:12,280
all been for. As we will see in the episodes to come, there would turn out to be surprisingly little

12
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:15,430
agreement about what the revolution was supposed to have meant.

13
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:21,820
Before we get into it, though, I need to make a few corrections that have been helpfully passed along.

14
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:27,370
listener Malcolm expressed some surprise that the British would put an 86 year old Admiral in charge

15
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:34,030
of its navy and he was of course, right. Admiral arbuthnott got the pronunciation now to was 68 years

16
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:38,200
old, not 86. I was just some accidental dyslexia on my part.

17
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:43,840
listener Dylan points out that Camden, South Carolina isn't really on the border between the Carolinas

18
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,360
and that's also true and was badly worded on my part.

19
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:51,910
It's down about 75 or 80 miles or so. So you know, it's near the border, but not on the border.

20
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:57,760
Finally, listener, Elizabeth reminds me that the quote about Philadelphia taking how rather than how

21
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:02,710
taking Philadelphia comes from Benjamin Franklin, not George Washington, which of course it does.

22
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:07,660
I don't know how I got that wrong, but I did. Especially since there's an old rhetorical trick where

23
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:12,370
if you don't know who said something, you can just attribute it to Benjamin Franklin or also Mark Twain,

24
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:17,290
and no one will ever call you out on it even works if you've got some pithy quote of your own, you want

25
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:21,820
to test out on your friends, you know, I believe it was Benjamin Franklin, who said never trust a man

26
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:25,150
who says that his favourite kind of music is whatever's on the radio.

27
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:34,210
So thank you guys for keeping me honest. Okay, so when we left off last time, in March 1781, Cornwallis

28
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:37,360
had just quote unquote, won the battle of Guildford courthouse.

29
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:43,030
The air quotes are there because the heavy casualties the British suffered not only further pinch, Cornwallis

30
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:46,660
has strategic options, but also badly eroded the morale of his men.

31
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,670
Even more than their commander the rank and file had been suffering through this year in the Carolinas

32
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:55,840
fighting battles that settled nothing, defending positions that controlled nothing.

33
00:02:56,140 --> 00:03:01,240
And all the while getting jumped by guerrillas eating rotten food and contracting all manner of disease

34
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:04,750
was all turning out to be as deadly as it was pointless.

35
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:09,520
And now their only reward for having driven the Americans from the field at Guilford Courthouse was

36
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,950
to find that a quarter of their comrades were dead or wounded.

37
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:16,420
Are we any closer to securing the South than we were yesterday? No.

38
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:21,040
Are we in fact probably even further away than ever? sure looks like it.

39
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:28,210
On the other side of lines, General Nathaniel Greene was regrouping from the quote unquote loss at Guildford

40
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:34,300
courthouse by proposing a bold initiative to plunge into South Carolina and start attacking all those

41
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:38,050
little Garrison's Cornwallis had spread across the countryside in the previous year.

42
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:43,990
It was a good idea because it would put Cornwallis in a bind or so Greene thought.

43
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:49,420
The British General could either follow the American South and engage in more running battles that would

44
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:55,060
exhaust his been physically and emotionally or he could stay and try to consolidate his hold on North

45
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:58,870
Carolina, leaving green to have the run of South Carolinaon a post.

46
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,000
But his sound his greens reasoning seem to be Cornwallis already had a third option in mind.

47
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:12,660
Is he Cornwallis was just as discouraged as his men about their prospects in the Carolinas.

48
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:17,670
The strategy of systematically moving from south to north was proving to be a bust.

49
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:22,800
It had been entirely dependent on a partnership with a loyalist population that had turned out to be

50
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,220
neither as plentiful nor as helpful as the British assumed.

51
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:31,740
But even as the whole war now really started to slip away from the British for good.

52
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:36,720
Cornwallis dreamed up yet another grand strategy to try to salvage the situation.

53
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:43,110
In a letter to Clinton purportedly asking for instructions, Cornwallis laid out what he thought those

54
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:48,510
instructions ought to be. That Cornwallis should have been in the Carolinas move into Virginia, make

55
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:52,260
a base on the Chesapeake Bay. From that central pivot point.

56
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,590
They would then divide and conquer the rebel colonies once and for all.

57
00:04:56,610 --> 00:05:00,630
And so when green plunged into South Carolina, and Cornwallis did not follow.

58
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:05,310
It wasn't because he was trying to hold North Carolina, but because he was trying to get out of there

59
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:13,470
as quickly as possible. In the middle of April 1781, Greene put his plan in motion and move first on

60
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:19,680
the 900 British steel garrison in Camden, South Carolina, under the command of Lord rondon, who was

61
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,480
left as the senior British officer in the state. When Cornwallis decided to march away to Virginia.

62
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:31,530
Green led a column of about 1500 directly to Camden, while smaller detachments were sent around to lock

63
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:34,770
up the countryside and cut off supplies and communication lines.

64
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:41,520
On April the 23rd, Francis Marion and light horse Harry Lee, famous cavalry Colonel and father of Robert

65
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:47,250
E. Lee, succeeded in capturing fort Watson just south of Camden, after they constructed a large tower

66
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:49,770
that allowed sharpshooters to fire inside the fort.

67
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:56,190
But Camden proved a tougher nut to crack. The British had built up the defense's since the Americans

68
00:05:56,190 --> 00:06:01,710
had last been in the area. Unable to storm the steady right away, green pulled back about a mile to

69
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:06,870
an elevated position called hob Kirk's Hill, and could only hope to induce the British to come out and

70
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:13,440
fight. Luckily for green, Lord ridden was both nervous about what would happen when the forces under

71
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:19,200
Marion and Lee link back up with green. And he'd been tipped off by a desert that the Americans had

72
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:24,840
no artillery. So if he was going to stop the seed before it began, now was the time to do it.

73
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:30,539
So on the morning of April the 25th, he led his men out of Camden, skirting the edge of a swamp to hit

74
00:06:30,539 --> 00:06:37,560
the hopefully unsuspecting Americans. The Americans were in fact caught by surprise, but the British

75
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:40,650
were then themselves surprised to find that the deserter had been wrong.

76
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:43,890
Green did have himself a nice little battery of artillery.

77
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:50,220
The British came up in a narrow line, so green ordered his now scrambling into line forces to envelop

78
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:53,130
them. While he pasted their centre with the heavy guns.

79
00:06:53,789 --> 00:06:58,350
The British took a sharp and unexpected beating but managed to keep themselves composed.

80
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:04,110
Meanwhile, the American regiment supposedly enveloping the left flank, saw their commander get shot

81
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:09,180
down and then in a confused attempt to recruit round up easy prey for a hard charge by the British that

82
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:14,100
scattered them. Meanwhile, the American cavalry that had been sent around the other side got bogged

83
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:18,030
down taking some prisoners and never made it back around to the battle in time.

84
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:23,880
So Greene was forced to withdraw from the field. But as with Guildford courthouse, the Battle of hobb

85
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:29,400
Kirk's Hill was another Pyrrhic victory for the British, with 40 dead and over 200 wounded.

86
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:37,260
With the Americans controlling the surrounding area, Lord ridden recognise that Camden was a lost cause.

87
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:41,010
On May the 90 abandon the city and headed south for Charleston.

88
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,470
After breaking off a detachment to go capture Augusta, Georgia, a mission that went off without a hitch,

89
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:53,700
Greene took the rest of his forces west to drive off the 550 man garrison, mostly loyalists, the town

90
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:59,760
of 96, South Carolina Don't ask me why it's calledthat there's apparently a half dozen different legends

91
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:05,580
to explain it. Greene settled in outside the fortified village on May the 22nd with about 1000 men.

92
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:11,220
But the British fortifications again precluded an immediate attack so green had to lay siege.

93
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:17,190
But after a few weeks of digging trenches, news arrived that ridden was personally leading a 2000 man

94
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:23,340
relief army out of Charleston, having just been reinforced by the men he had sent to take Augusta green

95
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:29,159
decided to mountain attack on 96 on June 18, for the British reinforcements can show up.

96
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:34,409
The attack started well for the Americans. But as they pushed forward, their officers started getting

97
00:08:34,409 --> 00:08:38,730
shot up under heavy fire and the men fell back to the safety of their trenches.

98
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:44,039.
With ridden breathing down his neck green with drew back to the relative safety of Charlotte.

99
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:50,970
But as with Camden, the tactical defeat was a strategic victory as Ratan simply collected the loyalists

100
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:54,450
at 96 abandon the village and headed back to Charleston.

101
00:08:54,840 --> 00:09:01,770
Now, the only spot left in South Carolina, the British still controlled it anyone personified the old

102
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:07,800
cliche of losing the battle, winning the war. It was Nathaniel Greene in the southern Theatre of the

103
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:16,470
American Revolutionary War. Backup in the north, the stalemate that had persisted for the last few years

104
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:22,890
was finally about to break loose, but not without some touching go trouble for General George Washington.

105
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:32,069.
over the winter of 1780 1781, the inevitable finally occurred, mutiny in the continental ranks.

106
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:38,580
The amazing thing, of course, is that it had taken this long, the grievances of the soldiers were as

107
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:45,150
many as they were justified. They were badly fed, badly supplied, paid late, and then when they were

108
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:51,600
paid at all given worthless continental script. One of Washington's great accomplishments perhaps the

109
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:57,540
great accomplishment is that he exuded such a force of inspirational leadership that his men had endured,

110
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:06,540
without ever taking any fatal steps. Sure desertion was a daily problem, but not mutiny, never mutiny.

111
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:13,620
But on New Year's Day 1781 1200 men from the Pennsylvania line wintering in Morristown, New Jersey had

112
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:18,270
had enough. They revolted against their officers killing a few in the process.

113
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:22,800
And then they set out for Philadelphia to force the Congress to address their grievances.

114
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:30,240
Now, these guys were loyal patriots, and their rallying cry was actually we're not Arnold's but enough

115
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:38,280
was enough. Washington was concerned about confronting them personally fearful that his aura of authority

116
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:44,040
might be shattered if they did not submit. So he dispatched mad Anthony Wayne to nip it in the bud.

117
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:48,360
Wayne let the mutineers crossed the Delaware River, and then surrounded them.

118
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:53,310
Negotiations produced an agreement that half of these guys would be released from service altogether,

119
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:59,490
and the rest furloughed until spring. But Wayne did identify the ringleaders and ordered them shocked,

120
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:04,950
though he was forced to also threatened to shoot the assigned executioner's when they hesitated to fire

121
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:11,790
on their own comrades. Then, almost as soon as this crisis passed, another 200 men from the New Jersey

122
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:18,420
line mutinied. Washington again stayed away personally, but ordered this time that there'll be no negotiations

123
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:25,920
this had already gone too far. The 200 mutineers were surrounded and offered no terms they submitted,

124
00:11:26,069. --> 00:11:32,940
and again, the ringleaders were shocked. With the benefit of hindsight, we also now know that these

125
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:39,390
two mutinies were merely prelude to the really big mutiny that will bubble up next week, a mutiny that

126
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:44,730
leads to one of the most dramatic single moments of the whole revolutionary era, the moment when the

127
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:50,910
Continental Army did not follow the example of the New Model Army, because Washington refused to be

128
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:57,540
cast as an American Cromwell. The mutinies though did highlight the pressing necessity for more loans

129
00:11:57,540 --> 00:12:02,550
from the French. And over that same winter, Benjamin Franklin managed to not only secure more money,

130
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:06,060
but yet a deeper commitment for military assistance.

131
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:10,620
So to go back a little bit to catch up with the French.

132
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:16,980
After failing to take Savannah in 1779, the comp distain had sailed home, where he was understandably

133
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:24,510
replaced in the spring of 17. At a new fleet was dispatched carrying 7000 land forces that would join

134
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:29,100
with Washington's army. This army larger even than the one Washington himself.

135
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:32,550
Currently lead was commanded by the comp de roshambo.

136
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:36,870
This fleet landed in Newport, Rhode Island in July 1780.

137
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:40,560
Odd Did I mention the British pulled out of Newport at the end of 1779.

138
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,860
I didn't. Man there's a lot of moving pieces here.

139
00:12:44,579 --> 00:12:47,490
The British moved out of Newport at the end of 1779.

140
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,460
So the French landed at Newport and the army disembarked, but then the British Navy promptly swung in

141
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:59,220
and blockaded a lot of them. With the Navy trapped roshambo refused to leave them unsupported to the

142
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:01,770
plan link up with Washington was delayed for the year.

143
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:08,970
Things might have gone on like that indefinitely, but in January 1781, a storm blew through New England

144
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:11,850
that drove the British blockade from its position outside Newport.

145
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:17,760
The French fleet was now free to manoeuvre, and the French army under roshambo was free to start making

146
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:23,610
plans for a joint operation with Washington, though both the French army and French Navy maintain their

147
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:31,020
base at Newport. The timing of the storm was fortuitous, because just a few weeks earlier, Henry Clinton

148
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:37,770
had decided to put the trader Benedict Arnold to good use, and put him in charge of about 1500 men in

149
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:43,890
late December 1780 aren't a lead these forces down on a rate of Virginia, surprising the local militias,

150
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:49,710
destroying the supply infrastructure and temporarily capturing Richmond the capital, but he didn't have

151
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:54,780
the manpower to hold it. So Arnold withdrew to the coastal city of Portsmouth, where he holed up and

152
00:13:54,780 --> 00:14:00,960
waited for reinforcements. With the trader Arnold threatening his home state, Washington dispatch the

153
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:07,560
now trusted practically to the point of being a surrogate son, Marquis de Lafayette, down with 1200

154
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:13,170
men to shore up the defences. He also successfully convinced the newly freed French Navy to follow in

155
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:20,910
support. As they sail though, the Nao regrouped British fleet under 174 year old Admiral arbuthnott

156
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:27,210
followed, a brief skirmish ensued. On both fleets hit Virginia at just about the same time, the French

157
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:32,580
decided to withdraw back to Newport, leaving the British for the moment in control of Chesapeake Bay.

158
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:41,640
While all of this was going on in early 1781, another French fleet this one bound for the West Indies,

159
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:48,300
set sail under the command of Admiral to grace. The grace had served with distinction under sustained

160
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:51,060
during the first run through the Caribbean in 1779.

161
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:56,910
And it was expected that he would wage a more vigorous and cooperative campaign than his predecessor

162
00:14:56,910 --> 00:15:03,090
had. This second French fleet say All the way from Europe without so much as a Hey, where are you going

163
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:08,880
from the British Navy. This was mostly because further French and American diplomacy had brought both

164
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:12,180
the Spanish and Dutch into the anti British Alliance.

165
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:19,080
Neither was technically declaring for the Americans, but they both declared against the British which

166
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:24,660
for the moment was just as good. These new threat to the home waters turned the British Ministry cross

167
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:28,260
eyed and upside down, so they failed to send any ships to America.

168
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:32,640
They might even the balance of power at sea when this second French fleet took off.

169
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:39,660
This meant that as soon as the grace sailed into the Caribbean in April 1781, the French and by extension

170
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:46,890
their American allies, now enjoyed a serious advantage at sea advantage, it was about to prove decisive.

171
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:55,020
As the end game approaches, the next major piece entered its final position when Clinton sent yet another

172
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:59,640
army into Virginia in April 1781 to continue the devastating rains.

173
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:06,330
After swinging through Portsmouth to pick up Benedict Arnold this for soon number just over 3000 Baron

174
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:11,490
von stuben and the local Virginia militia tried to hold their ground, but they were forced back to Richmond,

175
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:16,950
the British pursued, but Lafayette and his Continentals linked up with von stuben, just in the nick

176
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:22,800
of time. The British let them have Richmond and went back to writing all the while being reinforced until

177
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:28,920
they numbered close to 6000. When the British General in charge suddenly dropped dead in May, Arnold

178
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:34,140
found himself the senior officer in charge position he held for just about a week, because that's when

179
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:40,319
Cornwallis and his 1000 plus exhausted men dragged themselves into Petersburg, a strategically important

180
00:16:40,319 --> 00:16:48,720
city located on a tributary of the James River. In leaving the Carolinas, Cornwallis was pretty much

181
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:55,640
disobeying orders,but he didn't really care Clinton was being in communicative and indecisive and obviously

182
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:59,090
failed to recognise just how much the situation in the south had changed.

183
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:04,040
Not that Clinton sought to discipline Cornwallis because for the moment, the commander in chief was

184
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:07,970
occupied with amping his vacillation up to dizzying speeds.

185
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:13,280
He ordered Cornwallis to pick a spot on Chesapeake Bay and fortify it for use as a permanent base of

186
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:16,880
operations. Okay, good. Check, I was already going to do that.

187
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:21,950
Then Clinton ordered him to break off whatever forces he didn't need and send them back up to New York.

188
00:17:22,069. --> 00:17:27,589
Kay, but I don't really want to do that. But then the orders changed, and Cornwallis was to send these

189
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:33,710
troops to Pennsylvania, which that doesn't seem like but then the orders changed again, and it was no

190
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:39,620
On second thought do send them to New York. Cornwallis appears to have endured this vacillation by never

191
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:44,960
actually sending the troops Clinton demanded. He did however, follow the order to build a fortified

192
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:52,010
base, not necessarily where he would have liked, told by Clinton to fortify either Williamsburg or Yorktown.

193
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:55,460
Cornwallis selected Yorktown as the lesser of two evils.

194
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:59,390
It was a decision he would regret for the rest of his life.

195
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:05,840
But for the time being, the British were still mostly ascended in Virginia and continued their devastating

196
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:11,240
raids, including the famous moment when Bannister Carlton nearly captured Thomas Jefferson, who was

197
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:15,110
now governor of Virginia, missing him by just 15 minutes.

198
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:21,770
So we all know that the coming Siege of Yorktown will end the war.

199
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:27,620
And as Cornwallis settled into Virginia, various American and French leaders started to recognise that

200
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:30,620
he was offering them just such a golden opportunity.

201
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:37,700
But it would appear that the one guy who was absolutely not recognising this opportunity was George

202
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:43,880
Washington. From the earliest days of the war, Washington had been convinced that in the end, it would

203
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:49,700
all come down to New York City was one of the reasons he had maintained such a steadfast vigil all these

204
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:55,490
years. Since 1776, that had been a major base of operations for the British.

205
00:18:55,790 --> 00:19:01,880
And since Clinton took over the central base of the British Army, capturing New York City was obviously

206
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:07,580
the thing. So after the French fleet was freed from Newport, it seemed to Washington like he was finally

207
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:13,520
circling the drain on this obsession, then roshambo told him that their second French fleet was down

208
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:19,100
in the West Indies, was probably about to come north and help so it's all falling into place, right.

209
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:26,570
But roshambo did not really like the look of trying to take New York City, nor did some of Washington

210
00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:32,330
subordinates but the general was utterly fixated on the idea and kept pressing roshambo to mass the

211
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:39,830
French fleet to New York as soon as possible. In fine French diplomatic fashion, roshambo sues Washington

212
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:45,650
with carefully worded assurances, all the while, relaying messages to his French admirals that Cornwallis

213
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:48,710
was a sitting duck in Virginia, that that would be the target.

214
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:54,860
He just had to talk Washington into it. There has been some historical debate about this over the years,

215
00:19:55,370 --> 00:20:00,260
but Ron Chernow, his recent biography of Washington makes it pretty clear that Washington Didn't get

216
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:05,240
religion on Yorktown until the very last minute. And once he got it he got it.

217
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:10,370
Especially after he was told that Yorktown was where Cornwallis was entrenching because he himself had

218
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:15,620
once warned a subordinate American officer earlier in the war, not to dig in at Yorktown because it

219
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:21,470
would be too easy to capture. Washington's fixation with New York though did pave the way to victory

220
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:28,310
at Yorktown in one important way. It convinced Henry Clinton not to send more reinforcements to Cornwallis

221
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:34,310
because he was convinced Washington was about to hit him now was because Washington was convinced Washington

222
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:41,960
was about to hit him, if that makes sense. In the end, the decision to pivot to Virginia appears to

223
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:48,889
have been presented to Washington as a fait accompli in mid August roshambo told Washington that 1000

224
00:20:48,889 --> 00:20:53,780
apologies, but it seems that Admiral de grace has made up his mind to make for Chesapeake Bay.

225
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:59,450
I know, I know. But what can you do? Do his very great credit though.

226
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:05,810
Washington swallowed this and turned it into one of his great triumphs, the lightning march to Yorktown.

227
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:12,110
Just a few days after receiving the news, he sent parties out to start making it look for all the world

228
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:15,110
like he was about to launch an amphibious attack on Staten Island.

229
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:20,990
Then Washington broke his men into three columns and marched them at staggered intervals into New Jersey.

230
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:24,350
All of this further convinced Clinton and attack was coming.

231
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:29,300
And he did not realise until way too late that Washington wasn't coming back.

232
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:34,670
The Americans linked up with the French in Princeton, and we're through Philadelphia before Clinton

233
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:41,660
understood what was really going on. Over the next three weeks, Washington and his army managed to cover

234
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:46,639
450 miles of not especially easy terrain in some pretty rotten heat.

235
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:52,460
It was one of those astonishing bits of logistical genius that Washington seemed to deliver effortlessly,

236
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:58,160
and it gave the Allied American and French forces the Head Start they needed to squeeze Cornwallis before

237
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:02,420
Clinton could respond. By the time they were making their final approach.

238
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:07,460
The French fleets had mast at the mouth of Chesapeake Bay and run off the outnumbered British fleet

239
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:13,160
who said oh wow, there's a lot of UC later. Washington road ahead to meet with the grace and plan the

240
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:18,020
operation. It was somewhat chagrin that Doug Ross was only promising to stay until November the first

241
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:26,600
that turned out to be more than enough time. While Washington was on the road, and general green down

242
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:31,430
in South Carolina finally came down from the hills he had been camped in for the summer and made a march

243
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:38,930
of his own towards Charleston. He was now leading 2200 men, an equal mix of Continentals, militia man

244
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,170
irregular forces, and just you know guys with muskets.

245
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:48,200
On September the eighth, they surprise the British Field Army camped at Utah springs about 30 miles

246
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:52,610
northwest of Charleston. The surprise British were quickly pushed back and confusion.

247
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:58,190
But instead of holding together and finishing the fight, the Americans like I say a pretty uneven mix

248
00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:01,580
of characters decided to plunder the British camp instead.

249
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:07,460
This allowed the British to regroup and come charging back in to drive off the mob of looters.

250
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:13,610
But now that he knew Greene's army was in the area, there was nothing for Lord rudden to do, but pull

251
00:23:13,610 --> 00:23:16,400
his forces back into Charleston and wait for further orders.

252
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:21,680
He would still be waiting for those orders when he got the letter that the war was over.

253
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:30,890
Backup in Virginia, the combined French and American armies now numbering about 16,000 made the final

254
00:23:30,890 --> 00:23:37,370
advance on Yorktown on September the 28th. Cornwallis initially had both an outer and inner line of

255
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:41,930
defence, but he quickly abandoned the outer line and pulled all the troops he had now somewhere around

256
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:49,010
8000. Inside the city, Washington quite rightly deferred to his French allies who were well trained

257
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:54,740
in the art of siege craft. Digging began immediately for the steady advance of parallels.

258
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:59,870
Through the first week of October, the Americans and French dug towards the city than the artillery

259
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:05,570
got set up and the shelling began making life absolutely miserable for everyone inside Yorktown.

260
00:24:06,410 --> 00:24:10,280
During these days, Cornwallis seemed curiously inactive.

261
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:16,280
He had set up shopping a grotto that served as a natural bunker and was simply in during the shelling.

262
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:21,560
What was going through his mind we'll never know. But he might have been expecting reinforcements from

263
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:25,850
Clinton to come bail him out. But those reinforcements would never come.

264
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:32,510
On October the 14th, the second parallel was completed and the Americans launched a nitrate on some

265
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:36,770
British positions. morale inside Yorktown was now gone.

266
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:42,860
Cornwallis had one available option now, and that was to ferry his men across the James River and maybe

267
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:48,440
make a run for it. But after he put the first 1000 men across a storm kicked up and put a stop to it.

268
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:54,590
Or Wallace now saw the writing on the wall. And the next day he sent an emissary over to Washington

269
00:24:54,590 --> 00:25:01,730
to talk terms or law was asked to be allowed to surrender with full military honours, but Washington

270
00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:05,780
replied that the British would receive the same honours the American troops that Charleston had been

271
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:18,080
allowed, which is to say no honours at all. At 11am on the morning of October 19 1781 8000, British marched

272
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:21,020
out of Yorktown through a double line of American and French troops.

273
00:25:21,889 --> 00:25:26,720
As the British March, they tried to focus all their attention on the French line, and pretend like the

274
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:31,670
Americans weren't even there, until the Continental band started playing Yankee Doodle Dandy to get

275
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:38,480
their attention. Then, in another calculated snub, Cornwallis himself refused to come in person, sending

276
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:44,780
a subordinate along to surrender his sword, recognising a slap in the face when he saw it, Washington

277
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:48,680
refused to take the sword, and directed one of his own subordinates to go pick it up.

278
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:54,740
It was a bitter piece that was made that day, but it was a piece.

279
00:25:57,650 --> 00:26:01,730
Now, of course, the victory Yorktown did not necessarily have to end the war.

280
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:05,420
Clinton was still up in New York, the Navy was still out there.

281
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:09,320
And it was technically possible that the British could just send over more troops and more ships.

282
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,990
That certainly what King George the Third wanted to do.

283
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:16,820
But the reaction of Lord North the news of the surrender pretty much summed it up.

284
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:23,240
Oh, God, he said, it's all over. It was hopeless to try to carry on and everyone knew it.

285
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:28,040
The time had come to concede the war, settled the thing and move on.

286
00:26:29,930 --> 00:26:33,500
Next week, we will discuss what it would mean to settle the thing.

287
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:39,650
A formal peace treaty would have to be brokered between Britain and her now former colonies, the last

288
00:26:39,650 --> 00:26:44,370
of the British troops would have to be removed.And then of course, the Americans would have to figure

289
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:47,820
out what to do their newfound independence.
