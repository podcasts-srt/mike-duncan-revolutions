00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:20,200
Hello, and welcome to revolutions Episode 29. the Articles of Confederation as I said at the end of last

2
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:24,790
week's episode, the siege of Yorktown did not have to end the American War of Independence.

3
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:31,030
The British still had forces in Canada and New York and Charleston and Savannah, and navy sailing off

4
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:33,489
the coast of North America and down in the West Indies.

5
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:37,210
Plus, they had an Empire's worth of resources to draw from.

6
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:42,640
Meanwhile, the Americans were still the loose confederation of now economically deprived colonials,

7
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:47,200
who field in an army that seemed perpetually on the brink of dissolution, and whose allies in Europe

8
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,620
help them only so long as it suited them and didn't cost too much money.

9
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:57,190
So the war couldn't possibly end with the Americans destroying Britain's ability to make war.

10
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:01,330
It had to take the form of destroying Britain's desire to make war.

11
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:07,330
And that's exactly what Yorktown did. It was the final spoonful of vinegar in a cocktail that had already

12
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:13,150
started to taste pretty rotten. Facing the prospect of having to start over from scratch, British political

13
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:19,240
opinion turned decisively in favour of peace, Lord North was finally able to resign in March 1782.

14
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:24,280
And in his parting remarks, he said bluntly that anybody who tried to carry on the war was an enemy

15
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:32,560
of Britain. So how did the British managed to screw this up so badly? The list is endless and varied.

16
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:39,490
So we'll confine ourselves to the big picture. From the very beginning, the British Ministry, Miss diagnose

17
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:43,540
the problem, and then tenaciously clung to their initial misdiagnosis.

18
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:48,640
And by that, I mean that they were convinced that this was all the work of a tight click of super radicals

19
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:53,770
who couldn't possibly represent a broad popular coalition that included men and women from every geographic

20
00:01:53,770 --> 00:02:00,010
region, and socio economic rank. That's not to say the Americans were all against them, not by a longshot.

21
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:06,070
But you don't get so many people willing to sacrifice so much, and then keep sacrificing for six years.

22
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:10,720
If this is all about a bunch of hyper extremists ruining things for everyone else.

23
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:14,260
The British Ministry just kept thinking the majority of Americans were loyal.

24
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:22,120
And it really wasn't true. With this misdiagnosis in place, the British then pursued a totally incoherent

25
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:27,460
set of policies. They never could decide whether they were waging a war of military destruction or political

26
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:32,740
reconciliation. So you have things like the bombing of Norfolk and Burgoyne threat to unleash the Iroquois

27
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:38,320
and the raids in Virginia all designed to force the Americans to their knees using Total War Tactics,

28
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:44,320
while at the same time, you have house amiable leniency and Clinton's promise for amnesty to rebels

29
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:48,370
who lay down their arms designed to coax the Americans back into the British fold.

30
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:54,580
Adding to this incoherence was the fact that neither stick nor carrot was pursued with enough vigour

31
00:02:54,580 --> 00:03:00,490
to be effective. The stick only hardened patriot resolve, the carrot only made them laugh.

32
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:07,810
This incoherence speaks to the rather harsh conclusion that in terms of military and political leadership,

33
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:10,630
this was simply not Britain's Greatest Generation.

34
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:16,300
The politicians were divided, they undercut each other, and just seemed to lurch from strategy to strategy

35
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:19,270
without ever stepping back and getting a handle on the big picture.

36
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,060
And the senior military officers were not much better.

37
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:26,680
Thomas gauge might have been the only one to see what the British would face if war broke out, and he

38
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,890
was sacked for accurately predicting what it would take to win the war.

39
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:35,650
William Howe was so confident in British superiority and so sympathetic to the American cause, that

40
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:39,370
he repeatedly let opportunities to crush the Continental Army pass.

41
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,460
Gentlemen, Johnny Burgoyne was so confident in his own superiority that he blundered into total defeat.

42
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:50,380
And re Clinton was moody and paranoid and soured on the job almost immediately.

43
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:55,810
Lord Cornwallis was a great military tactician, but clearly lacked the kind of political acumen this

44
00:03:55,810 --> 00:04:01,840
particular war required. And all the while they too fought petty little battles amongst themselves,

45
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,410
though, I'm less inclined to add that to the causes of their defeat.

46
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:11,560
So as the American generals were running around in their own camps, with knives just as long and this

47
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:14,410
is all to say nothing of the complete misuse of the Navy.

48
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:20,170
For most of the war, this all important advantage was used to ferry troops around and not much else.

49
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:25,660
When they finally were cut loose a bit after Saratoga, there was zero cooperation between the Army and

50
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:29,770
the Navy. I mean, all told this was just a badly run war.

51
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,470
But all that said, we should also take a look at the fact that as much as the deck seem to be stacked

52
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:40,090
in Britain's favour at the outset, the Americans did hold a few trump cards that actually made their

53
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:43,690
victory less implausible than contemporary observers might have allowed.

54
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:49,450
For one, and the American patriots were fighting for something, namely, independence.

55
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:54,880
It was a simple goal. It was a fixed goal. And it was an internalised goal that is one that even the

56
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,990
lowliest private knew he was fighting for. This helped sustain the war.

57
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:02,230
through trials that really ought have broken American resolve.

58
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:06,490
And that touches on another trump card, which is home field advantage.

59
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:10,870
American soldiers were on their own land fighting for their homes and their families.

60
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:17,080
Defeat meant who knows what depravations. But for the British regular, the German hash and defeat meant,

61
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:22,750
oh, well, I guess we go home now. Fighting in your own backyard is not always a decisive advantage.

62
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:28,540
But when you wander through the pages of history, you usually find preternatural resiliency in the armies

63
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:35,620
of the invaded, not the armies of the invaders. Finally, you have the fact that Britain had enemies

64
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:39,730
just waiting in the tall grass looking for an opportunity to whack them over their head when the time

65
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:44,650
was right. without help from Europe, no amount of patriotic resiliency would have been enough.

66
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:48,340
But Britain did have enemies, and they were waiting in the tall grass.

67
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:50,710
And then they did whack the British over the head.

68
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:59,380
Then, of course, there is George Washington. As we have seen, Washington was not some American Napoleon.

69
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:05,170
His battle plans were too complicated. His strategic vision at least militarily was not super keen.

70
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:10,330
And as much credit as the Americans get for their shooting, hide guerrilla tactics, Washington himself

71
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:13,480
never ran with the idea of the way a more creative general might have.

72
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:18,460
And he focused obsessively on turning the Continental Army into a European style army.

73
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:23,650
But all that said he was basically the perfect man to run the war for the Americans.

74
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:29,650
Because that same focus on turning his men into a professional army gave them the political credibility

75
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:33,250
they needed when the French finally did decide to come out of the tall grass.

76
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:38,890
And it was his own personal commitment to the republican ideals represented by American independence,

77
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:43,120
that infuse the army with the belief that they were fighting for something.

78
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:48,460
And then of course, there was his ability to simply hold the army together whether through brilliantly

79
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:52,390
executed retreat, or obsessing about supplies and logistics.

80
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:57,970
The overriding strategic goal for the Americans turned out to be simply keeping an army in the field,

81
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:01,450
as long as they could do that the war would not be lost.

82
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:06,610
And there was probably no man in america better suited for that job, and George Washington.

83
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:14,710
Okay, so now that the British have lost the war, or at the very least decided that they didn't want

84
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:18,340
to try to win it anymore. It's time to move on to the peace process.

85
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:21,490
process that will take just about two years to complete.

86
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:26,680
From the moment Cornwallis surrendered at Yorktown to the final final signing ceremony in September

87
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:34,090.
1783. To represent the Americans, the Congress selected five men, Benjamin Franklin, of course, still

88
00:07:34,090. --> 00:07:39,250
charming the pants off of French society, john adams, who was currently in The Hague trying to arrange

89
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:45,610
more loans from the Dutch, john Jay of New York, currently in Madrid trying to secure recognition because

90
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:50,380
those Spain had joined the anti British coalition, they did not yet technically acknowledged that the

91
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:56,530
United States was, you know, a thing. Another guy named john Lawrence, who had been held in a London

92
00:07:56,530 --> 00:08:03,310
prison after being captured at sea in 1780. And then Thomas Jefferson, but Jefferson would back off

93
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:06,880
citing personal obligations probably surrounding the recent death of his wife.

94
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:13,240
And Lauren's wound up being a non factor. So really, the triumvirate was Franklin, Adams and J.

95
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:17,950
Of whom Franklin was the most savvy and Adams the most obnoxiously principled.

96
00:08:20,080. --> 00:08:25,150
The peace commission now was hamstrung immediately by Congress's instructions that they consult with

97
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:28,360
the French every step of the way and follow French advice.

98
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:34,000
Even Franklin, a major Francophile could see how crazy this order was.

99
00:08:34,539 --> 00:08:39,100
France and America were our allies. But that did not mean their interests were perfectly aligned.

100
00:08:39,309 --> 00:08:42,159
What was good for France might not be good for America.

101
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:48,280
So to demand that the Americans play essentially a subordinate role in their own negotiations seemed

102
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:55,060
like folly. And of course it was, but it appears to be folly that the French purchased fairly on the

103
00:08:55,060 --> 00:09:00,970
open market, as they funnelled cash to congressional representatives who drew up the instructions on

104
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:05,589
the understanding that those instructions would tend to strengthen the ties between France and America.

105
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:14,740
Wink wink nudge nudge, saying no more.Informal talks began in April 17 82 between Franklin French Foreign

106
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:21,010
Minister version and the lead British negotiator Richard Oswald, an ageing Scottish merchant with old

107
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:25,900
commercial ties to America. When the other American Commissioner started arriving over the summer, the

108
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:31,450
real talks got going. They immediately hit a wall when Oswald claimed he did not have the authority

109
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:35,590
to recognise the independence of the United States prior to negotiations.

110
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:41,530
Franklin insisted on the point however, and though it seems a subtle distinction, it was an important

111
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:46,930
one, because Franklin wanted to be sure that independence was not a part of the concessions the British

112
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:52,750
offered. American Independence was already a fact, it was no longer Britain's to concede.

113
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:59,320
By September though they all agreed to a formulation that allowed both sides to have their way and Oswald

114
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:04,900
agreed that he was trading with representatives of the United States, which went far enough to satisfy

115
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:09,820
the Americans, while falling just short of the formal recognition he couldn't yet provide.

116
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:15,910
Not surprisingly, the British negotiating strategy was to divide the Americans from the French.

117
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:20,800
And at first informal side talks between the French and the British seemed like they were about to lead

118
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:26,560
the French to sell out key American demands. Because the French the more than happy to blow off American

119
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:32,260
issues like say Newfoundland fishing right. And tell word reached Paris that Admiral grace had just

120
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:37,630
been trounced in the Caribbean, which left the French in a far weaker positioned to bargain alone.

121
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:43,810
The re united French and American front though soon gave way to side talks between the Americans and

122
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:49,510
the British, during which Franklin seized on the opportunity to get most of what America wanted without

123
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:56,170
French interference. In November 1782, the British and Americans worked out the basics of a bilateral

124
00:10:56,170 --> 00:11:02,200
agreement. version was shocked, learned of the agreement just hours before it was signed, having been

125
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:07,120
kept in the dark about the talks, he direct violation of Congress's instructions.

126
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:12,670
But Franklin placated version and the French by pointing out that the deal would only go into effect

127
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:17,890
after the French sign their own treaty with the British was a definitely played manoeuvre, and almost

128
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:22,900
certainly one more for the Americans than they would have gotten had they let version do all the talking.

129
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:31,540
The foundation of the Treaty of Paris, which wouldn't be all dressed up in fancy cursive and tell September

130
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:39,850
1783 was thus in place. It was first of all, between his Britannic majesty and the United States acknowledged

131
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:46,120
to be sovereign and independent. It's at the borders of the new United States at the 31st parallel in

132
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:51,730
the south, that is the Georgia Florida border. In the north, it was that irregular jagged line that

133
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:54,610
mostly forms the border between the US and Canada today.

134
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:02,470
In the west critically, the line was set at the Mississippi River, not the old 1763 proclamation line.

135
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:08,590
Open fishing off the Canadian Coast was granted, as was for access to the Mississippi River.

136
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:15,069.
In return for all this, the American commissioners agreed that all debts owed by Americans to British

137
00:12:15,069. --> 00:12:19,720
creditors would be honoured in full, which was a fairly controversial concession.

138
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:25,630
The British then further pressed for all confiscated loyalists property to be returned to their rightful

139
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:29,170
owners. Now this would be really, really hard to sell back home.

140
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:34,840
So Franklin promised to urge the Congress to urge the state to return the loyalist property.

141
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:40,420
Finally, all British troops would withdraw with all deliberate speed.

142
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:44,050
And though the force is embedded on the Atlantic seaboard would soon be gone.

143
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:48,340
The British dragged their feet about removing their frontier Garrison's because hey, I mean, we still

144
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:52,750
plan to dominate you economically. And if you think we're just going to give up the Great Lakes for

145
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:56,230
trade, because Cornwallis got trapped in Yorktown, you're crazy.

146
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:59,620
It would remain a sticking point for years to come.

147
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:06,730
While all of these negotiations were going on in Europe, American leaders began the process of trying

148
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:12,760
to figure out how to transition from war to peace, and how to transition from colonial dependency and

149
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:19,180
full fledged, independent nation. These two issues would collide in the neuberg conspiracy of March

150
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:26,290
1783. And then continue to linger even after that crisis past colliding again with Shay's rebellion in

151
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:31,960
1786, which we'll talk about next week. And at which point a consensus had built up that the current

152
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:36,160
system of national government was unsustainable and needed serious revision.

153
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:44,110
The current system of national government they were talking about is now pretty much a punch line in

154
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:52,870
American history, the Articles of Confederation way back in 1776, just before the Declaration of Independence

155
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:57,819
was signed, the Second Continental Congress created a committee to draft a National Constitution to

156
00:13:57,819 --> 00:14:01,030
go along with all those state constitutions that were being drafted.

157
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:07,440
This committee wound up being chaired by our old friend john Dickinson,remember him from way back when

158
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:13,590
letters from Pennsylvania former opponent of independence were as he opposed independent his committee

159
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:18,930
will simultaneously drafting a National Constitution for the soon to be independent United States.

160
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:25,650
When the draft emerged from committee though it met strong resistance, a debate erupted that preview

161
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:29,550
the much larger debate over the constitution 15 years later.

162
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:37,890
taken as a whole, Dickinson's draft undeniably put the national government above the states and worked

163
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:43,260
out a formula whereby Congress would hold all powers, except for those specifically reserved for the

164
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:49,050
states. Now, the delegates in the Second Continental Congress were frankly appalled by this arrangement.

165
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:54,120
Most of them had just spent the last decade arguing relentlessly for the sovereignty of their local

166
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:57,600
governments and against the tyranny of a powerful central government.

167
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,850
And here they were supposed to swallow a pretence.

168
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:06,990
tyrannical central government. So as the draft was debated, clauses were struck and clauses were added

169
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:10,740
and struck and added until the formula was reversed.

170
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:17,250
the Articles of Confederation and perpetual union were finally approved in November 1776.

171
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:24,030
vested all sovereignty in the several States, granted to Congress only a few specifically enumerated

172
00:15:24,030 --> 00:15:28,230
powers. It was the exact opposite of what Dickinson intended.

173
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:34,020
Now, one thing Dickinson's draft and the final draft had in common, though, was that the national government

174
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:40,230
would not have the right to tax. This was completely understandable given the whole revolution is rooted

175
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:45,000
in a tax revolt, but it would prove the undoing of the Articles of Confederation.

176
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:52,050
The debate about the articles previewed the debate over the Constitution in two important and related

177
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:58,620
ways. First was the question of representation. The Second Continental Congress being an assembly of

178
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:02,069.
the colonies had adopted a one colony one vote rule.

179
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:06,600
So little Rhode Island had a voice equal to enormous Virginia.

180
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:12,480
Representatives of the larger states tried to use the debate over the Articles of Confederation to get

181
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,690
this shifted to representation based on population.

182
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:21,990
But it quickly became clear that this would fatally torpedo union, as the smaller states had no interest

183
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:27,540
in becoming mere satellites of Virginia. And the Congress of the Confederation continued as an assembly

184
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:33,840
of states, rather than an assembly of the people at large, each state would have one vote.

185
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,330
The other issue was how revenue obligations would be assessed.

186
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:44,520
Now, like I said, Congress did not have the right to tax, but everyone agreed that the several States

187
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:47,280
would still need to contribute to a general national fund.

188
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:54,030
Dickinson's draft calculated each state's obligation based off of population size, which was a huge

189
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:59,819
problem for the slave states, because slaves were being counted as people and that just didn't seem fair.

190
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:05,940
It was proposed then that only the white population be counted, but that met resistance from New England

191
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:09,089.
who thought that they would now be saddled with a disproportionate burden.

192
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:14,490
When this notion was dropped, the New Englanders were even more incensed when it was proposed to base

193
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:20,339
the assessment on land value, because an acre of land in small and crowded New England went for a lot

194
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:26,970
more than an empty and expansive North Carolina. But New England soon realised that they were fighting

195
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:32,010
a losing battle, as the south and Middle States joined in a consensus around land being the thing.

196
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:38,340
So for the moment, the issue of how to classify and count slaves, when are they people and when are

197
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:44,400
they property was for the moment skirted. They will, of course return in the utterly despicable three

198
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:49,620
fifths compromise lodged in Article One, section two of the Constitution, but we'll get to that.

199
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:55,170
And oh, by the way, the debate over how to calculate who owed what was pointless anyway, because Congress

200
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:57,930
had no mechanism to compel the state to pay their share.

201
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:05,550
The final draft of the Articles of Confederation and perpetual union was approved and sent out for ratification

202
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:12,120
in November 1777. But it was not adopted until March 1781.

203
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:17,970
This delay was caused by the requirement that every state had to ratify before the articles would go

204
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:22,230
into effect. And Maryland really, really didn't want to ratify.

205
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:27,720
As we will see, the unanimous consent requirement was a mistake that the framers of the Constitution

206
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:34,800
will conspicuously not make. Ironically, the big sticking point for Maryland was not that Congress would

207
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:37,500
have too much power, but then it would have too little.

208
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:43,350
They wanted Congress to have jurisdiction over the unincorporated Western lands, power that had been

209
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:48,480
stripped out during the debates. Now Maryland was not alone in this, they were joined, for example,

210
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:54,870
by New Jersey and Delaware. What these three states had in common was that their founding colonial charters

211
00:18:54,870 --> 00:19:01,770
set specific borders, rather than having super vague from sea to sea clauses, like in say the Virginia

212
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:06,060
charter, written by men who had noidea how far away the Pacific Ocean really was.

213
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:12,390
unless Congress could step in and check the growth of Virginia or also like New York, there would be

214
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:15,750
nothing to stop them from becoming irresistible super states.

215
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:19,710
As the years passed, both New Jersey and Delaware caved.

216
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:26,010
But Maryland held out. Finally, New York agreed to give up its claims, mostly on the grounds that it

217
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:28,530
would be unwieldy to govern that territory anyway.

218
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:34,770
And then Virginia follow, they'll only renouncing their claims to land northwest of the Ohio River.

219
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:42,270
These concessions in place, Maryland finally agreed and on March the first 1781, the Second Continental

220
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:48,360
Congress became the Congress of the Confederation, or more officially, the Congress of the United States

221
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:55,800
assembled. Of course, as we all know, with the benefit of hindsight, the intentional weakening of the

222
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:59,160
National Congress made their jobs nearly impossible.

223
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:05,160
By the time the articles were ratified, Congress was deep in debt and had no way to pay it back.

224
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:10,140
And not only were they deep in debt, they had no idea how deep in debt they even were.

225
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:16,320
The bookkeeping had been a mess and wartime prioritising left them with a trail of certificates and

226
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:21,810
I owe us and vouchers and just verbal promises to pay men back for whatever.

227
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:27,000
Despite Washington's misgivings, the imperatives of war had led to forced requisitioning.

228
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:31,740
But a receipt was always scribbled on the back of a napkin or something to be redeemed when the war

229
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:36,660
was over. Well, now the war was over, and everyone was coming for what they were owed.

230
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:41,370
Compounding this debt crisis was the financial crisis.

231
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:46,320
Over the course of the war, Congress had been forced to turn to that always sustainable practice of

232
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:52,380
just printing money to pay for what it needed. Not only was this currency not backed by anything, they

233
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:57,900
just kept pumping out more and more. By 1780, they had sent out something like $200 million.

234
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:04,110
It was all worthless, and it led neutrals in and around British occupied areas to offer their goods

235
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:09,240
and services to the British in exchange for pound rather than accept continental script.

236
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:15,060
Those that had accepted the script were then hit with the most unwelcome news and 17 at the Congress

237
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:20,190
was about to try to get its financial house in order, and was officially revaluing the money at 140

238
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:24,090
at face value, which Awesome, so glad I accepted it.

239
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:32,010
Can't wait to do business with you again. No, where was the debt and financing problem more obvious

240
00:21:32,010 --> 00:21:38,700
and more dangerous. And when it came to paying the army, Congress had been getting by on empty promises

241
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:44,639
and worthless paper while the war was on his latest 1780 Congress promised all officers who stuck it

242
00:21:44,639 --> 00:21:48,750
out until the end of the war, a pension of half pay for the rest of their lives.

243
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:55,710
If you just please stay on. Now that the war was ending, the men understandably wanted, you know what

244
00:21:55,710 --> 00:22:01,470
they were owed. But for the moment, all Congress could do was hold out its empty hands and say we just

245
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:04,740
don't have the money. And we don't have any way to raise it.

246
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:10,320
Which brings us to the Newburgh conspiracy of March 1783.

247
00:22:11,639 --> 00:22:17,760
See, there were in Congress, many men who were not fans of the severely limited powers granted to Congress.

248
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:23,190
They wanted and argue that the country in fact needed stronger national government.

249
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:28,230
their colleagues at out voted them back during the debates over the Articles of Confederation.

250
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:33,510
But they sent in the growing restlessness in the army an opportunity to reopen the issue.

251
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:39,389
There were also many officers in the army who concurred with them about needing a stronger national

252
00:22:39,389 --> 00:22:44,250
government, not because they stayed up night reading political philosophy, but because they realised

253
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:48,030
they were going to get stiffed if Congress didn't have some way to raise money.

254
00:22:49,050 --> 00:22:54,600
So the congressional leaders started talking to the military leaders, and a scheme grew to leverage

255
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:58,530
more power for Congress by threatening the use of military force.

256
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:05,730
Specifically, the demand was the articles be amended to allow Congress to lay a 5% imposed on imported

257
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:10,139
goods and amendment that would require the unanimous consent of the states.

258
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:18,300
So if we compare this to the English revolution, we are roughly in about 1647.

259
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:24,660
Right after the first Civil War. The New Model Army wants what it has been promised, parliament is unwilling

260
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:31,110
or unable to give it to them. Fairfax and Cromwell elected back the men, and eventually they all march

261
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:38,100
on London. It was very orderly, but it collapsed any notion of the army serving its civilian masters

262
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:44,580
and not the other way around. As this moment approached in the American Revolution, though, George Washington

263
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:49,500
refused to be Fairfax or Cromwell in early March 1783.

264
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:54,840
Word reached the Continental Army camped at Newburgh, New York, but a preliminary piece had been signed

265
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:58,889
with Britain, meaning that they were sure to be disbanded sooner rather than later.

266
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:05,030
An anonymous circular letter then made the rounds for the officers to gather on March 11, to discuss

267
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:08,960
what action to take. When Washington got a hold of this letter.

268
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:13,970
He announced that there would be a meeting, but it will be held on March the 15th, after passions had

269
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:21,020
died down a little bit. When the officers gathered on March the 15th, they were shocked by Washington

270
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:24,050
surprise entrance, no one expected him to come in person.

271
00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:30,110
He politely asked for the floor so he could deliver a short speech, a short speech that was nothing

272
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:36,770
less than an impassioned plea not to go down this road, to not allow anyone to open the floodgates of

273
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:41,000
civil discord, and they lose our rising empire in blood.

274
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:46,760
When he pulled out a letter from a member of Congress, he wished to read aloud but to do so he had to

275
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:51,260
put on his glasses. And no one had ever seen the general wearing glasses.

276
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:55,460
I have no idea how much of this was planned and how much was spontaneous.

277
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:59,450
But as he put them on, he said, gentlemen, you will permit me to put on my spec.

278
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:04,910
calls for I have grown not only grey, but almost blind in the service of my country.

279
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:09,980
That is pretty much the end of the Newburgh conspiracy right there.

280
00:25:10,370 --> 00:25:16,340
And the moment when the Continental Army did not become the New Model Army, Washington had given everything

281
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:21,320
he had to this cause and cause that they were now all threatening to throw away over some back pay and

282
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:25,520
pensions. The air drained out of the conspiracy completely.

283
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:33,680
With the Newberg crisis passed, Congress promised its officers would get full pay for five years, the

284
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:38,960
enlisted men would get three months pay right now in exchange for peacefully returning home and that

285
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:44,450
seemed to do the trick. Washington Of course followed his performance at Newberg with a similar performance

286
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:49,640
at the end of the year, when in a carefully choreographed ceremony, gave up his commission.

287
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:56,000
This is the moment when people started referring to him as the American Cincinnatus, the man who gave

288
00:25:56,030 --> 00:26:01,610
up power, and also led George the Third to marvel at the sheer implausibility of it.

289
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:06,500
The king asked an American born painter what Washington would do now that the war had been won.

290
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:12,950
And the painter replied, they say he will return to his farm, to which the king replied if he does that,

291
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:19,310
will be the greatest man who ever lived. Like I say, George Washington was the perfect guy to run the

292
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:25,310
American war. if for no other reason than he seemed to have no design on running the American piece,

293
00:26:25,910 --> 00:26:29,690
not that destiny was actually going to let him retire to Mount Vernon.

294
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:37,070
Next week, the nationalist inclined members of Congress will continue their quest to make the national

295
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:43,550
government solvent request that will fail. As they talked among themselves about how to solve this problem,

296
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:49,040
a little rebellion flared up in western Massachusetts that exposed the terrible limitations of the Articles

297
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:55,550
of Confederation for all to see. So a call will be put out for a convention just to revise the articles,

298
00:26:55,550 --> 00:27:00,230
