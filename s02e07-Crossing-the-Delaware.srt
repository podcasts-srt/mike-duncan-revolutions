00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:07,180
Hello and welcome to Revolutions.

2
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:14,980
Episode 23, Crossing the Delaware.

3
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:23,130
So I want to start this week with a brief
note about Thomas Paine, common sense

4
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,980
helpfully provided in the comments by
listener T.

5
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:31,590
Scott Johnson. It would appear that a recent
book called The Republic in Print has pretty

6
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:35,790
effectively debunked the myth that common
sense reached anywhere near one hundred

7
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:40,380
thousand printed copies, which I'm glad to
hear because, as I said, one hundred thousand

8
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:42,800
copies was an impossibly huge number.

9
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:44,790
And it turns out that I was right about
that.

10
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:49,220
So thank you to Scott Johnson and good luck
with the Ph.D..

11
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:56,400
Last week, we left General Washington and
his boys at a low point, having spent their

12
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:01,620
first campaign season being beaten,
outmaneuvered and run off by early December

13
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:02,740
17. Seventy six.

14
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:07,500
The only thing Washington can point to as a
success was that his army was still in the

15
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:12,840
field at all. But in a few weeks, even that
small consolation might evaporate.

16
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:18,120
Washington had escaped across the Delaware
River with three thousand men, half of whom

17
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,970
had enlistment that were due to expire
December the 31st.

18
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,140
And that was on top of the two thousand men
who had already gone home when their

19
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:30,560
enlistment ran out November 30 with nothing
going for the American Army at all.

20
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:32,730
What was to stop it from simply melting
away?

21
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:36,210
Washington had managed to escape the
clutches of Gen.

22
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:40,830
Howe, but could he escape the clutches of
crushingly low morale?

23
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:43,410
The answer turned out to be yes.

24
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:49,910
Yes, he could. As you will recall, when
General Howe opted to put his men into winter

25
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:53,720
quarters, he left the Haitians to guard the
frontier of the Delaware River, which marked

26
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:57,320
the border between New Jersey to the east
and Pennsylvania to the west.

27
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:02,150
The Haitians and a string of garrisons up
and down the river, including the city of

28
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:05,180
Trenton, which was right smack dab in the
middle of that border.

29
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:09,650
I actually managed to put a map up this week
and managed to do one for the New York

30
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:11,690
campaigns from last week that I couldn't get
to.

31
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:17,810
These Haitian garrisons provided a desperate
Washington with one last chance to steal a

32
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:21,350
victory before the year was up and his
entire army went home.

33
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:27,740
Now, incredibly, as Washington got to
planning his operation, he received no

34
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:30,800
reinforcements from the army he had left
back up in New York.

35
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:35,030
You remember them? The fifty five hundred
men commanded by General Charles Lee.

36
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:41,840
Despite Washington's repeated pleas to send
troops, Lee just didn't do it, mostly because

37
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,160
Lee was busy waiting for the Congress to
come to its senses, ditch Washington and put

38
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,770
him in charge of the Continental Army.

39
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:53,930
And though Lee's belligerent ego was mostly
what was at work here on paper, he kind of

40
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:59,210
had a point. Charles Lee was born in England
in February 17.

41
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:04,580
Thirty two. So just a few weeks before
Washington himself, the son of a major, he

42
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:09,290
entered the regular army as a junior officer
at the age of 15 and never looked back.

43
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:13,520
He served throughout the French and Indian
war, taking an American Indian wife in the

44
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:18,530
process. Then he returned to Europe, served
in Portugal, and then when his regiment was

45
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:22,820
disbanded after peace with France, he went
off to serve as a mercenary in Poland.

46
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:27,470
Returning to Britain, he found himself so
sympathetic to the American cause that he

47
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:32,480
emigrated to Virginia in seventeen seventy
three, and when war broke out, he immediately

48
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,670
volunteered for service.

49
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:38,570
Now, given his record, he had little doubt
Congress would appoint him commander in

50
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:43,640
chief. But of course, there is also the
matter of Charles Lee's personality.

51
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:50,030
He was ill tempered, foul mouthed, slovenly
and followed everywhere by a loyal pack of

52
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:52,310
dogs who were really his only friends.

53
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:57,950
But probably the thing that really sunk him
was that he demanded pay pay that George

54
00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:01,610
Washington announced would be beneath his
own dignity to accept.

55
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:06,230
So Lee wound up instead being given command
of the Southern Department.

56
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:09,950
And in mid seventeen seventy six, he
received credit for helping Ward off an

57
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:14,990
attack on Charleston, although that warding
off was only accomplished after Lee's own

58
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:17,150
expert advice was ignored.

59
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:22,130
After Lee was transferred back up to New
York, Washington did everything he could to

60
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:27,110
placate Lee's ego because Washington was
himself always entranced by the European way

61
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:29,750
of war, a way that Lee knew better than
anyone.

62
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:36,080
It was indeed likely an overdose of respect
that led Washington to merely encourage,

63
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:40,850
rather than explicitly order, Lee to march
from New York down to Pennsylvania.

64
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:47,210
But Lee did not reciprocate this respect at
all and wasn't going to lift a finger to help

65
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:51,500
Washington because Lee was busy telling
everyone who would listen, including the

66
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:55,760
Congress and a steady stream of letters that
Washington was in way over his head and

67
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,290
basically losing the war.

68
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:04,970
As Washington's encouragement became less
and less veiled, Lee slowly, ever so slowly

69
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:10,250
got moving. But then comes the hilarious bit
on the road commander in chief.

70
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:14,780
In his own mind, Lee decided to spend the
night in a tavern while removed from the rest

71
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:18,710
of his army. The next morning, a mounted
British patrol surrounded the house and

72
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:22,340
captured Lee, who happened to be stark naked
at the time.

73
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:28,370
WAPs Lee would spend the next six months in
British custody before being exchanged for a

74
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:29,600
captured British general.

75
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:34,460
Given his conduct at Monmouth Courthouse, it
probably would have been better for the

76
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:38,630
Americans to exchange the captured British
general or a sack of potatoes.

77
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:43,760
So without further reinforcements, Washington
was forced to draw up a plan to attack

78
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:47,810
Trenton with what men he had on hand and oh,
what a plan it was.

79
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:52,700
Because as much as Washington was the master
of the flawless retreat, he was also the

80
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:55,190
master of the insanely complicated battle
plan.

81
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:59,090
And he was always coming up with these
schemes that involve twenty seven different

82
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:01,190
moving parts that needed to work in perfect
synchronization.

83
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:04,730
And his plan for Trenton was classic
Washington.

84
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:08,330
It was laid out in three phases.

85
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:12,920
First, seven hundred men would silently
cross the Delaware River and seize a key

86
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,180
bridge south of Trenton.

87
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:18,920
Then another fifteen hundred militia men
would cross even further south and launch a

88
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,960
diversionary attack on the garrison at
Bordentown.

89
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:26,540
Then Washington and his main force of twenty
four hundred men would cross the Delaware

90
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:31,280
themselves at midnight, divide into two
columns and take separate roads the nine

91
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:35,840
miles to Trenton. Then they would all
simultaneously be in position to strike the

92
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,640
city no later than five a.m..

93
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:43,040
So what we've got here is four different
columns that will be moving in different

94
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,510
directions at different times.

95
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:49,880
In the middle of the night, in the dead of
winter, all without tipping off the Hessians

96
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:54,620
and oh, by the way, if this doesn't work,
that's the end of the war.

97
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:59,930
Needless to say, this did not all unfold the
way Washington planned.

98
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:02,900
And it's frankly a wonder it all turned out
as well as it did.

99
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:07,850
The first two phases of the operation, for
example, failed immediately as neither the

100
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:11,930
advanced unit nor the diversionary force had
been able to cross at their assigned

101
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:16,850
locations due to the icy conditions of the
Delaware River FACT's Washington did not

102
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:19,100
learn until well after the battle was over.

103
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:23,540
Then those same icy conditions destroyed his
own timetable.

104
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:28,130
And though everyone worked as fast and as
well as they could, Washington's army wasn't

105
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:31,040
even ready to start marching until four a.m.

106
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:35,150
and according to the plan, they were already
supposed to be at Trenton by now.

107
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:39,080
But Washington pressed on, I mean, what else
could he do?

108
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:43,580
He divided his twenty four hundred men into
the two columns, one that would approach

109
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:47,110
Trenton from the north and one that would
come up and around from the south.

110
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:53,180
Amazingly, both these columns hit their
marks at almost the same time, just about

111
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:59,270
8:00 a.m.. As Washington led the final
approach, though, he ran into a small,

112
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:03,920
independent company of about 50 Americans
who knew nothing about the planned attack and

113
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:06,830
were returning from a little raid on Trenton
of their own.

114
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:10,970
A raid that had seen them exchange gunfire
with Heshan sentries.

115
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:15,890
Washington was mortified and thought his
entire operation was now exposed.

116
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:19,790
But it's possible that this raid actually
put the Hashim's mind at ease.

117
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,890
Is he? The Heshan colonel in charge of
Trenton had been tipped off a few days

118
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:29,420
earlier to watch out for a possible attack,
and he had kept his men on high alert and

119
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:30,760
running frequent patrols.

120
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:35,480
When this little raiding party came and
went, they thought the quote unquote attack

121
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:40,370
had now come and gone and relaxed because it
went without saying that in this crappy

122
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:43,100
weather, nothing more could be expected from
the Americans.

123
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:48,450
And that brings us to the myth of the drunk
and or hungover Hessians.

124
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:53,750
Unfortunately, for those of us who like a
good story, the myth is just that, a myth.

125
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:58,160
And eyewitnesses report that the Hessians,
though, caught off guard because they were

126
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,670
really not expecting a major attack given
the rotten weather.

127
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:06,860
They were stone sober before, during and
after the battle.

128
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:12,880
As Washington led his column to the north
side of Trenton, they skirmished with an

129
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:17,110
outpost about a mile outside the city,
forcing the Heshan guards into a fighting

130
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:20,860
retreat that alerted the rest of the
garrison in Trenton that something much

131
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:21,990
bigger was on the way.

132
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:26,140
But the Americans were able to place their
artillery in time.

133
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:31,840
One battery, which was commanded by a young
artillery captain named Alexander Hamilton as

134
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,710
the Hessians tried to form up for battle.

135
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,400
They were blasted into a chaotic mess.

136
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:40,930
The Heshan colonel rushed around, reforming
his men for a counterattack, but wound up

137
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:42,640
mortally wounded for his trouble.

138
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:47,170
By now, the Hessians were squeezed between
the advancing enemy on both sides.

139
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,570
And within an hour, the Battle of Trenton
was over.

140
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,750
Twenty two Haitians lay dead.

141
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:58,300
Another eighty four were wounded and almost
a thousand captured, along with a bounty of

142
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:01,600
musket bayonet cannons and provisions.

143
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:05,920
The Americans suffered just two combat
deaths and a few light wounds.

144
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:11,740
It was exactly the kind of unambiguous,
absolutely clear cut victory that Washington

145
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:12,850
and the Americans needed.

146
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,970
The whole thing had been an enormous gamble.

147
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:20,230
And had it failed, who knows whether the
American rebellion would have gone down as

148
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:22,270
little more than a historical footnote?

149
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:29,620
Now, Washington's original plan was as
ambitious as it was complicated, and he hoped

150
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:33,000
to use the momentum from Trenton to
immediately push on to Princeton.

151
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:37,360
But the night's delays, coupled with
exhaustion, coupled with the news that the

152
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,800
other advanced units never had crossed the
river, led Washington to call it good right

153
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:46,810
there. And he led his men and prisoners back
across the Delaware away from easy British

154
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:51,490
retaliation. The next day, though,
Washington and his war council learned that

155
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:55,120
the militiamen that were supposed to have
been running the diversion down south and now

156
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,300
operating independently had elected to cross
the Delaware.

157
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:03,580
With this force already on the other side,
Washington decided to follow them back into

158
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:08,560
New Jersey. So on December the twenty ninth,
Washington sent his men back across the river

159
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:13,810
to occupy Trenton, which had the added
benefit of making it just a little bit harder

160
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:17,520
for those men who plan to ditch out on
January the 1st to do so.

161
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:23,860
When that fateful day did arrive, Washington
gave impassioned addresses and offered

162
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:26,080
bounties were just six more weeks service.

163
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:32,110
And of the roughly five thousand now had on
hand, he was able to hold three thousand, at

164
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:36,400
least for the time being joined by the
militiamen who had crossed further south.

165
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:40,900
Washington now had five or six thousand men
under his immediate command.

166
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:47,490
Meanwhile, General Howe was not going to
take the attack on Trenton lying down.

167
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:50,290
Well, maybe he would, but his army sure
wouldn't.

168
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:56,380
And he dispatched 8000 men under Lord
Cornwallis to stamp out this burgeoning

169
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:57,640
American resilience.

170
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:03,100
Cornwallis marched through Princeton,
dropped off a garrison, and then headed down

171
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:05,200
to Trenton with fifty five hundred men.

172
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:10,840
He was harassed the entire way by American
Forward Unit, whose sole job was to make him

173
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:14,320
and his men hate their rotten luck for being
stuck on this assignment.

174
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:19,690
When Cornwallis got to Trenton, he found the
Americans drawn up on a ridge south of town

175
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:22,570
with a creek between them and the
approaching British.

176
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:28,300
Cornwallis tried three times to cross the
bridge, but when each attempt failed, he

177
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:32,020
decided to halt for the day and resume the
attack in the morning because from where he

178
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:35,700
was sitting, Washington and his men were
basically trapped up on that ridge.

179
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:38,440
But local knowledge can be a powerful weapon.

180
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:43,090
And during the night, leaving a few men
behind to tend the line of fires and shoot

181
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:48,220
random cannon shots, Washington led his army
down back roads that weren't on any map.

182
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:54,490
When dawn broke on January the 2nd, Cornwall
was found, the ridge empty and the British

183
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:57,780
garrison left at Princeton found itself
under attack.

184
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:03,030
The garrison was already on their way to
join Cornwallis for the final assault on the

185
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:07,500
ridge when they were hit by the army that
was supposed to be trapped up on that ridge

186
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:11,900
and the initial fighting, the Americans were
driven back and started to run for it.

187
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:16,620
But Washington himself soon appeared on
horseback, rerouted the fleeing men and

188
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:18,180
pointed them back in the right direction.

189
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:23,430
In the midst of all this, there was a moment
when Washington was riding around between the

190
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:28,320
two lines, shouting encouragement to his men
when both sides started firing at once.

191
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:34,440
Absolutely inexplicably, when the smoke
cleared, Washington was still just riding

192
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:37,470
around. Not dead, not even hit.

193
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:43,050
Following this miracle, the bulk of the
British forces were able to push through and

194
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:48,870
run south for Trenton while the rest were
pushed back and captured in Princeton with

195
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:52,450
yet another victory in hand and Cornwall is
bearing down on him.

196
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:57,150
Washington decided that it really was time to
call it quits for the year, and he led his

197
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:59,550
men into winter quarters in Morristown, New
Jersey.

198
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:07,430
Morristown was about 25 miles west of New
York City and well situated to stymie the

199
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:12,200
British, if they got it in their heads to
move on Philadelphia or move up the Hudson

200
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:18,320
River. Now, as we will see, winter was a
dreadful time to be a soldier in the

201
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:24,230
Continental Army. We're talking no clothes,
no food, only super rudimentary shelter.

202
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:25,310
There was disease.

203
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:27,020
It was just the pits.

204
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:32,180
But we'll talk more about it when we get to
the famously hard winter next year at Valley

205
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:36,620
Forge. And then a bit more when we talk
about the less famously but even harder

206
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:38,120
winter back in Morristown.

207
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:44,450
The year after that, these conditions made
retaining soldiers so difficult that the fact

208
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:47,300
that anyone stayed at all is positively
miraculous.

209
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:53,360
Washington's whole army was down to just
three thousand men by March with expiring

210
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:57,590
terms, desertion and smallpox taking their
heavy toll.

211
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:03,320
As spring came, recruiters for the
Continental Army did their best and the total

212
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,650
was back up to nine thousand.

213
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:08,990
But these recruiters were stymied by
Washington's old nemesis, the colonial

214
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:14,000
militias who offered higher bounties, better
pay and better terms of service.

215
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:20,240
Begging, pleading and demanding that local
leaders stop poaching able bodied men would

216
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,050
be a constant refrain from Washington all
through the war.

217
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:29,420
But at least for the moment, his other bouts
of begging, pleading and demanding for guns

218
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:34,310
and supplies got a little boost when
American agents in France were able to set up

219
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:38,570
back channel supply lines from the French
government run through a front company in

220
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:43,100
Paris. The French were obviously interested
in seeing the colonials take it to their

221
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:48,110
British enemies, but throwing in with the
Americans completely was still out of the

222
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:55,530
question. So at this point, we're going to
separate the two great threads that define

223
00:15:55,530 --> 00:15:57,220
the war in 1777.

224
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:01,920
Today, we're going to stick with General
Washington as he fails to keep the British

225
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:06,180
out of Philadelphia and then fails to knock
them out after they seize the capital.

226
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:09,000
That will take us all the way to the end of
the year.

227
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:15,570
But of course, as this is unfolding in
Pennsylvania, the turning point of the war is

228
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:17,370
unfolding in upstate New York.

229
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:21,990
And we will talk about that next week
because otherwise it'll just be too much

230
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:27,510
hopping around as everything is happening
simultaneously in September and October 17.

231
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:34,320
Seventy seven. So sticking with Washington,
the campaign season of seventy seven did not

232
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:38,400
get going until mid-June when General Howe
decided it was high time.

233
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:43,950
He set out on that one more year of good
campaigning to finish off the rebellion on

234
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:48,390
June 17th. How moved a large force off
Staten Island and flashed them around New

235
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:51,570
Jersey, hoping to lure Washington into a
decisive battle.

236
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:54,660
But Washington did not take the bait a week
later.

237
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:57,810
How maneuvered around again trying to draw
out the Americans.

238
00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:01,640
But Washington managed to squeeze his men
out of a trap in the nick of time.

239
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:07,920
These ploys having failed how elected to
abandon New Jersey and then pull off the

240
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,240
mainland completely.

241
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:15,720
A stunt like this for the great reason why
the Americans were doomed without foreign

242
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:21,240
assistance, because without an enemy navy to
stop him, how could do things like put

243
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:25,890
eighteen thousand men on transport ships,
set out onto the high seas and then put them

244
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:31,210
back in wherever he wanted, which is exactly
what he did in the summer of 1777.

245
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:35,340
I mean, you could guess where his army was
going to suddenly reappear, but there was no

246
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:36,440
way of knowing for sure.

247
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:41,210
And it understandably became Washington's
great obsession over the summer.

248
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:45,630
The available options, though, were
basically three fold.

249
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:51,090
Go after Philadelphia from some angle or
another, head north to link up with the

250
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:52,860
Bourgoyne expedition coming down from
Canada.

251
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:57,660
That's what we're going to talk about next
week or transfer the whole focus of the war

252
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:59,310
and head down to like Charleston, South
Carolina.

253
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,860
Now, from everyone's point of view, it is
the British ministry, the American War

254
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:07,560
Council, the unanimous judgment of history.

255
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:12,900
What how needed to do was go link up with
begoing, but for a variety of reasons.

256
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,070
We'll talk about next week.

257
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,540
That did not happen.

258
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:20,250
And from at least April forward, how had his
eye on taking the rebel capital in

259
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:22,740
Philadelphia once he put out to sea?

260
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:27,810
The only question in his own mind was where
exactly and when exactly he would land to

261
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:28,830
make that attempt.

262
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:36,080
The endlessly and helplessly frustrating
days of speculation and inactivity finally

263
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:41,000
ended for Washington at the end of August,
when Howe put into Chesapeake Bay, about 50

264
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:47,060
miles southwest of Philadelphia, while Howe
let his men recuperate, the month at sea had

265
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:48,080
been pretty awful.

266
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:52,640
Washington got his army marching south,
picking up militia companies along the way

267
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:57,380
until he commanded nearly twenty thousand
men on the way to the confrontation with the

268
00:18:57,380 --> 00:19:02,180
British. The American army entered and then
marched as smartly as they could through the

269
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:03,420
streets of Philadelphia.

270
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:08,630
Washington tried to put on as good a show as
he could, but even a casual observer could

271
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:14,450
tell that these boys did not step as lively
nor look as sharp as a professional army

272
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:16,370
ought to step and look.

273
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:24,730
Meanwhile, how was now on his way north with
15000 men harassed, as he was now the custom

274
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:27,100
by small detachments of American forces?

275
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:33,010
Washington move west out of Philadelphia,
and on September the 10th, he decided to drop

276
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:37,150
a line of about fourteen thousand
Continentals and militiamen at Brandywine

277
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:42,370
Creek. There were only a few places the
British army could afford the river and the

278
00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:47,550
Americans work to cover those spots and make
the main road into Philadelphia impregnable,

279
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:51,490
unfortunately, as had been the case at Long
Island.

280
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:57,610
The Americans left open a pair of Fords on
the very far right of their line, possibly

281
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:02,620
because they just did not know they were
there, how they found out about these open

282
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:07,390
Fords. So this time it was the British
rather than the Americans who enjoyed that

283
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:09,730
all powerful weapon, local knowledge.

284
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:16,650
At four a.m. on September the 11th, how sent
forward a detachment of five thousand men

285
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:21,480
under one of the Heshan commanders to feign
a frontal attack while he and Cornwallis led

286
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:25,680
the rest of the army on a wide flanking
maneuver across those unguarded forts.

287
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:30,330
Now, one of the questions looming over the
Battle of Brandywine is that it appears

288
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:34,710
Washington heard that something was up on
his far right as early as nine thirty a.m.,

289
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:37,770
but he did not act and no one really knows
why.

290
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:41,750
But it was possibly just because he didn't
believe the report.

291
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:46,620
But by 2:00 in the afternoon, the bulk of
the British forces were across the creek and

292
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:49,560
threatening the utterly exposed American
right flank.

293
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:54,270
Quickly, the American forces reformed a line
to stop them, and they were given a little

294
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:58,740
breathing room because how in Cornwall took
their sweet time forming up for the attack.

295
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:03,420
By four o'clock, though, that attack came
and it quickly became apparent that b

296
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:07,450
scrambling Americans had left a hole in
their hastily reformed lines.

297
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:11,970
The British poured through that home and no
American reinforcements showed up and brought

298
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:17,190
everyone some time. The fighting descended
into brutal, ugly chaos, and the Americans

299
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:20,640
broke and ran, not in any kind of classic
Washington led order.

300
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:22,410
This was panicked flight.

301
00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:28,170
Meanwhile, back where Washington had thought
the battle was going to take place, the

302
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:32,340
Heshan commander had waited for the sound of
house attack to press right up the middle.

303
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:37,350
They fought their way across the creek and
engaged in fierce close quarters combat.

304
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:41,910
But the fighting had started so late in the
day that darkness soon forced both sides to

305
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:45,570
pull back. Washington wasted no time
catching his breath.

306
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:50,280
He and his men were beaten and beaten bad,
and they had to get the hell out of there and

307
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:54,810
regroup. So while the British did take a
breather, the Americans spent the night in

308
00:21:54,810 --> 00:22:00,660
full retreat. The Battle of Brandywine was
yet another clear cut victory for how over

309
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:05,580
Washington, though somehow the American army
still stood between the British and

310
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:11,360
Philadelphia. A week and a half later,
though, how maneuvered around and trick the

311
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:15,710
battered Americans into following him away
is up the Schoolkid River before doubling

312
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:21,530
back and crossing at a lower Ford that left
the way to Philadelphia wide open on

313
00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:25,310
September 18th. The delegates of the Second
Continental Congress learning that they were

314
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:29,540
exposed, booked it eventually New York,
Pennsylvania, where they would remain in

315
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:30,910
exile for the next year.

316
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:37,630
But when the British marched into
Philadelphia on the 26th, looking every bit,

317
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:40,930
the professional army, the Continentals had
just shown themselves not to be.

318
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,080
It wasn't the decisive blow Howe had hoped
it would be.

319
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:46,510
I mean, hello, I just took the capital.

320
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:47,960
That means it's time to surrender.

321
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:50,830
Hello. You guys even know how to play this
game?

322
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:56,250
But the Americans did not know how to play
that game, and Washington and his men

323
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:59,850
retreated twenty five miles outside of the
city to plan their next move.

324
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:06,300
Once in Philadelphia, how had to scatter his
forces so they wouldn't trip over each other

325
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:07,410
trying to sleep and eat.

326
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:12,630
But knowing that the American army was still
out in the neighborhood, he concentrated nine

327
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:18,270
thousand men at Germantown, about five miles
north of the city, Washington and his

328
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:24,150
officers decided that taking the forces at
Germantown was risky but too juicy to pass up

329
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:28,280
because for the moment, the Americans would
actually outnumber the British there.

330
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:34,140
And if it went totally right, a victory at
Germantown, along with the utterly astounding

331
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:38,300
American victory up at Saratoga, might just
be enough to win the war.

332
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:42,900
I mean, seriously, despite everything, the
Americans were in a really good position to

333
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:46,500
win the Revolutionary War right there in the
fall of 1777.

334
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:54,140
As with Trenton, Washington's battle plan
for Germantown was a perfect work of art,

335
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:57,210
just as long as it didn't try to, like,
leave the tent.

336
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:02,270
It involved four columns setting out on a
night marches so that they could

337
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:07,370
simultaneously attack Germantown from four
different directions at dawn, which is all

338
00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:09,410
well and good except that it's night.

339
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:13,670
The terrain is difficult and some of the
columns have much farther to March than

340
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:17,270
others. Oh, also a heavy fog is about to set
in.

341
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:22,940
It would be hard enough to pull off
Washington's plan for Germantown with modern

342
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:24,800
communications without them.

343
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:26,620
Well, good luck, everybody.

344
00:24:27,530 --> 00:24:31,190
They did at least think to stick a piece of
white paper in everyone's hat so that they

345
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:34,550
could tell their friend from their enemy
when they all got to the other side.

346
00:24:36,730 --> 00:24:41,170
A force marched through the night of October
the 3rd and 4th, put the various columns

347
00:24:41,170 --> 00:24:46,120
close to Germantown without yet being
detected, but only one of the flanking

348
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:48,280
columns reached tended position when Dawn
came.

349
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:54,280
Finally, around 5:00 a.m., the American
column that was aiming right at the heart of

350
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:58,720
town came rolling in and kicked off the
battle by firing on British guards who

351
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:04,240
sounded the alarm. At this point, General
Howe actually came riding out personally to

352
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:08,680
convince these guards to hold firm, since
they were only facing a few obnoxious

353
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:13,630
raiders. When the American cannons started
going off, though, how pulled back and his

354
00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:14,950
men quickly followed him.

355
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:16,790
This was no party of raiders.

356
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,780
This was a full scale attack.

357
00:25:20,930 --> 00:25:25,190
But then the Americans started making
mistakes instead of driving forward, they got

358
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:29,570
bogged down at a stone house on the edge of
town fortified by the British.

359
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:33,040
Washington's options were either bypass it or
try to take it.

360
00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:35,750
He almost elected to bypass it.

361
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:40,940
But Henry Knox convinced him that the oldest
war manuals in the world said never leave a

362
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:44,750
strong point in your rear and promised that
his artillery boys could take it.

363
00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:49,430
But after an hour of banging cannonballs off
the side of the house, it turned out that

364
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:51,560
Knox's artillery boys could not, in fact,
take it.

365
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:55,520
And they were just wasting time, ammunition
and more than a few men.

366
00:25:57,550 --> 00:26:01,330
Meanwhile, the other American, Collum,
started pouring into town from their

367
00:26:01,330 --> 00:26:05,770
different directions, but the heavy fog made
everything super confusing.

368
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:09,760
One unit fell back because they thought they
were exposed when they really weren't.

369
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:14,380
Another detachment coming in from the flank
took a wrong turn and wound up banging into

370
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:16,990
those retreating guys, and they all started
firing at each other.

371
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:22,810
Meanwhile, the last column to arrive, led by
Nathaniel Green, pushed into the mix and his

372
00:26:22,810 --> 00:26:25,480
advanced companies managed to actually
capture a bunch of prisoners.

373
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:30,220
But then those advanced units were
themselves surrounded, believing the rest of

374
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:36,640
the army in retreat, green, too, withdrew,
realizing that this had all gone awry.

375
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:41,590
Washington ordered a full retreat and his
army was chased for nearly 10 miles before

376
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:45,130
Greene's forces were able to buy the rest
time to get away completely.

377
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:52,620
The battle of Germantown was yet another
defeat for the Americans, but oddly enough,

378
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:56,910
it actually helped Benjamin Franklin make
the all important case he was currently

379
00:26:56,910 --> 00:27:02,340
making to the French, because despite it all
ending in failure, European observers in

380
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:06,840
America were impressed by the sophistication
of the plan, the bravery of the troops.

381
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:09,360
And as always, the disciplined retreat.

382
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:14,820
It had all gone haywire in the fog, but you
really can't blame them for that.

383
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:19,740
And one or two breaks and Germantown would
have been a smashing American success.

384
00:27:21,790 --> 00:27:26,230
So it was clear by the end of seventeen
seventy seven that the Continental Army had

385
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:32,380
shaped up to be a real army, not just some
pretend mob of hooligans, but this was little

386
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:36,640
comfort for Washington himself as he and his
army settled into their famously hard winter

387
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:40,690
at Valley Forge because he was forced to
dwell on the defeats at Brandywine in

388
00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:44,340
Germantown and question his own ability to
win the war.

389
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:48,040
And he was not the only one asking those
questions.

390
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:56,540
Next week, though, we are going to go back
in time to the spring of 1777 and run through

391
00:27:56,540 --> 00:28:01,040
the Saratoga campaigns up in the north,
which started with British General John

392
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:06,170
Burgoyne setting out on what he thought was
some kind of luxurious triumphal parade and

393
00:28:06,170 --> 00:28:08,990
ended with him handing over his sword.
